DISPATCH SPEC — wave {wave} ({letter}), {group}: {notes}
Brief: E:\COBOL\.claude\skills\workstream\templates\fix-lane-implementer-brief.md — read it WHOLE first; {{PB}} = {lead}.
Base: your worktree is cut from current main ({base}). CLAUDE.md rule 1 carries the ISO → GnuCOBOL → IBM/Micro Focus
precedence for implementation options; obey it.

Codes allocated: {codes}, in order; list the ones you use and RETURN the ones you do not.
Report: {reports}\{slug}-{lead}-report.md   (the ONE reports directory the enqueue unit reads, whatever this wave's scratch: kb/Work PB2980; wave-prefixed, so a later agent never overwrites an earlier report)
Scratch:  {S}\{slug}\
Report your ACTUAL branch (`git branch --show-current`).
{pred}
THE GROUP IS ONE ROOT: {root}. Read every note first — {files} — they carry the forensic detail, the citations, the
probes and the CODE SITES. ⛔ ORIENT IN ONE CALL, BEFORE READING ANY SOURCE FILE: `python
tools/claude-skills/skills/agent-fleet/references/orient.py <every source file your notes name>` (a fresh worktree
has no submodules: if that path is missing, run `git submodule update --init tools/claude-skills` once; the project
settings come from `.agent-fleet.json`, so pass no flags) prints each file's outline with line numbers, the clauses it cites, the tests
that exercise it, what EARLIER implementers learned about it (the landed notes' code sites and mechanisms) and its
recent commits. Then read only the line ranges it points you to, and use `python scripts/spec/where.py <clause>`
for a rule no note locates. Do not re-survey the codebase: orientation (grep/read) was 46 % of every implementer's
tokens in waves 45–57, re-deriving what earlier waves had already learned.
Do not re-derive what the notes measured, but DO re-run every probe on your own build.
⛔ DRIFT RULES (MANDATORY-PRACTICES P11): before editing any file run `python scripts/spec/drift_rules.py <files>` and
honor every SPECIFIC rule it prints — the drift tests will enforce them at your gate anyway.
C# NAVIGATION (P13): find definitions, references and callers with the LSP tool (goToDefinition / findReferences / incomingCalls on the .cs file) before grepping; grep stays right for text, COBOL, docs and generated files.
LSP DIAGNOSTICS (P13, owner 2026-10-01): act on every diagnostic the language server reports for a file you edited (unnecessary using, unused variable, analyzer hints); fix it in the same change before you commit, or name in the report why you did not.

{body}

⛔ GRACEFUL STOP: before EACH new step check for TWO files, the owner's global stop {global_stop} and this fleet's own
stop {stop_file}; if EITHER exists, checkpoint-commit, write STATUS.md NEXT and your report, and return status SPLIT.
Never start a build or gate once one exists. No other STOP file is yours (another session's fleet stop is not).

⛔ HOW TO WAIT FOR A LONG JOB (measured 2026-09-22, wave 45; 2026-10-22, wave 1150): a workflow agent that ENDS ITS TURN
while a background command is running is RETURNED BY THE HARNESS AND THAT COMMAND'S PROCESS TREE IS KILLED. The gate
itself survives it (build-local starts it DETACHED in its run directory, kb/Work PB3536), but YOU must still block for
its verdict. So:
1. Start the gate in the background, logging to a file:
     PowerShell (run_in_background): pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/build-local.ps1 -Priority BelowNormal *> <log>
2. Then BLOCK in the foreground until the verdict line appears, in chunks under the 10-minute tool limit:
     Bash (timeout 590000): timeout 580 bash -c 'until grep -qE "=== BUILD-LOCAL GATE: " "<log>"; do sleep 5; done' ; tail -3 "<log>"
   If it times out with no verdict, issue the SAME command again. Do not use `sleep`; do not end your turn.
3. Only after the verdict line is in hand: record it, checkpoint, write the report, return the structured result.
4. AT YOUR TURN CAP ONLY, with the gate still running (kb/Work PB3536): the gate runs DETACHED, so your return does
   not kill it, and the wave awaits it for you. Hand it over only when it is gating your COMMITTED HEAD with nothing
   uncommitted (the checkpoint commit comes before the gate, and nothing is committed after it): its run directory
   is the `build-local: gate, run directory <run>` line of your log. Write STATUS.md (GATE: pending in <run>) and your
   report, its header `Status: GATE-PENDING` with `Gate run: <run>`, and return status GATE-PENDING with gate_run
   <run> and your head. A GREEN verdict makes the report finished (the review follows), any other a gate finisher.
   Never otherwise: before the cap you block (step 2).
A re-gate of a tree an earlier gate in this worktree measured GREEN answers at once from that record, its verdict line
saying `REUSED` (kb/Work PB3536): quote it as the gate's verdict.

⚠ SIZING: if the group proves to be two mechanisms, finish the first at its root, checkpoint at the note boundary, and
return SPLIT rather than pass the 220-turn cap.

⛔ RE-PROBE FIRST, EVERY NOTE, on YOUR build (`dotnet build Cobol.Net.sln -c Debug`, expect 0/0). A note that no longer
reproduces is re-verdicted and reported DISCHARGED with the evidence — a real outcome, not a failure.

⛔ CITATIONS: `python scripts/spec/cite.py --check <clause> "<text>"` for EVERY § you write into code, a golden or the
report — including the ones the notes carry. A citation you did not --check is not a citation.

⛔ PUBLIC SKILLS (MANDATORY-PRACTICES P10): before work read E:\claude-skills\skills\engineering-standards\SKILL.md,
dotnet-engineering\SKILL.md and spec-oracle\SKILL.md; for the sibling sweep apply variant-analysis\SKILL.md (+ roslyn-analysis
for compiler-fact queries); before the report SELF-REVIEW your diff against E:\claude-skills\agents\pr-test-analyzer.md,
silent-failure-hunter.md and comment-analyzer.md (+ type-design-analyzer.md if you add/reshape a type). Project rules win on conflict.

⛔ SIBLING SWEEP (CLAUDE.md rule 4): every bug is a pattern. Which ARM of the dispatch did you fix, and where is the other?

GATE — ORDER, DON'T SKIP (owner 2026-09-28; kb/Work PB1708, PB1721): `pwsh scripts/build-local.ps1
-Priority BelowNormal` — nothing to derive, pass or trim. It takes a gate slot (`gate-slot: waiting, k ahead` is the cap
working: keep blocking), builds, and plans EVERY discovered case of Conformance, Unit and Characterization into two
legs — your added tests, your previous gate's reds, the host-only witnesses (tier 0h), the cheap tree-wide sweeps
(tier 0c), the drift tests that govern a file you changed (tier 0d) and the cheapest cases your change reaches in
leg 1 — FAIL-FAST. The gate has ONE shape (kb/Work PB3022): a
re-gate after a fix runs leg 1 again, never the population.
⭐ BATCHED GATING (owner 2026-10-10, kb/Work PB2515, MANDATORY-PRACTICES I1): the gate runs LEG 1 ONLY, names every
leg-2 case NOT RUN, and is done on `=== BUILD-LOCAL GATE: LEG 1 ONLY (batched gating, PB2515): GREEN — …`; a red
is `…: RED` — fix it and re-gate. The Linux half of the targeted leg runs INSIDE this gate (the same plan's legs in a WSL clone of your COMMITTED HEAD, under the
slot you hold: COMMIT BEFORE YOU GATE, kb/Work PB3612); `enqueue.py land` gates nothing again, it reads this gate's record and
refuses a head with none (exit 13); CI's merge-group run checks the population and the merge with main. (Only while the owner has set the shared implementer scope to `whole`, as `python
scripts/gate_slot.py status` shows, does it run both legs, stop `RED/INCOMPLETE` on a leg-1 red, and finish on
`=== BUILD-LOCAL GATE: GREEN — …`.) ALWAYS `-Priority BelowNormal`; one gate per worktree.
⛔ `python scripts/semgrep/verify.py` must not increase any rule's count (train 57 dropped a cluster for +20 BigInteger).
Print a real verdict line; never leave a placeholder in the report.

GOLDENS: one positive at the introducing edition + one negative below it, a copy per edition only where behaviour differs.
Every golden/negative you ADD runs in leg 1 of your gate — quote its `UnitTestResult` from `TestResults/build-local/<run>/leg-1-Conformance.trx` (MANDATORY-PRACTICES I7).
{linux_gate}
Parser + emitter + golden + manifest entry in ONE commit.

REGISTER: flip each note's `status` and write its `closes_rows` IN THE COMMIT THAT LANDS IT (with `closes_rows_reason:`
when it closes none). Run `python scripts/spec/work.py check`. Do NOT open a list anywhere. DEVLOG ENTRY (kb/Work PB3025; CLAUDE.md rule 6): write your branch's entry, UNNUMBERED, as `DEVLOG/pending-<slug>.md` — first line `## <Title>` (no number, no stamp), then the narrative: each mechanism, what the re-probe showed, the fix shape, the goldens, the rows re-verdicted, what the self-review found, the gate's verdict line — and commit it with your work; the landing numbers and stamps it (`python scripts/devlog.py stamp <branch>`), never you. FIX WHAT YOU FIND (I9, owner 2026-09-30): an issue you find in a file you have already read and understood is FIXED in this same change, with its golden and its sibling sweep, unless the effort is so excessive that it needs a redesign beyond your slice or would blow your turn budget. Only then file a kb/Work note (id from the orchestrator's allocation) carrying its repro path and code site (file:line) and why it was too large to fix now, and list it in the report. A found issue left only in prose or the DEVLOG is a defect in your work.

CHECKPOINT: `git commit -m "WIP checkpoint: …"` after every mechanism and every gate, and after EVERY commit (the small
trailing ones too: a gate-red fix, a regenerated index) rewrite `STATUS.md` (DONE / NEXT / BLOCKED / GATE / batch
paths / codes used) with FIRST LINE `STATUS-AT: <output of git rev-parse HEAD>` — the commit it describes (P4;
STATUS.md is gitignored, so writing it never moves HEAD). A hook refuses your next commit and your finish while the
stamp is not HEAD (kb/Work/PB1701). RESUMING or MERGING a predecessor:
run `python tools/claude-skills/skills/agent-fleet/references/status_delta.py <that worktree>` FIRST and read the summary plus ONLY the commits it lists.
Turn cap 220 — at the cap, checkpoint, write NEXT, return SPLIT.

Report ≤ 60 lines, following `templates/implementer-report-template.md`, one section per note.
SORT AND FILE I/O TESTS (MANDATORY-PRACTICES I11, the owner's standing rule): when your change reaches a SORT, MERGE or
file I/O statement, an I-O status, a declarative or the runtime's I/O, sharing, locking or sort code, read the I11 row of
`templates/MANDATORY-PRACTICES.md`. It is the rule's one home and lists every case. Test each abnormal and exception path
your change reaches as fully as its success path; expected values come from the cited rule. Your report's
`## Owner test requirement` section names those tests, or says why your change reaches none. A reviewer treats a missing
one as a finding.
BRANCH REVIEW (MANDATORY-PRACTICES I10, kb/Work PB3027): when you return DONE, one read-only cobol-reviewer reviews your
branch and stamps your report `**Review:** CLEAN|FINDINGS …` through `review_findings.py`; never write that line
yourself. A finding comes back to a review finisher, who answers each by its id in the report's `## Review findings`.
