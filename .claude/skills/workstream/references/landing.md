# Workstream landing order and mechanics (SKILL.md §3, full text)

## 3. Landing order and mechanics

- ⛔ **THE LANDING IS A SCRIPT: `python scripts/orchestrator/enqueue.py land <branch>` (kb/Work PB3023; MANDATORY-PRACTICES
  L1; DESIGN-test-build-ci.md §3.17.2 step 3).** One finished branch, one pull request. It merges origin/main into the
  branch (never a rebase: a branch that merged a same-file predecessor keeps its conflict resolutions), runs the ordered
  gate and CI's Linux legs on the merged head under the shared gate slot (a commit gated GREEN, or a head that differs
  from it only by main's commits, clean merges and DEVLOG-only commits, is not gated again), merges main in again when
  it moved during the gate (no second gate: the merge group runs the whole population on the current main), stamps the
  branch's `DEVLOG/pending-<slug>.md` (`devlog.py stamp`, the number from `alloc.py devlog`), runs the landing checks
  (`devlog.py check` 6, `landing_check.py` 3; none depends on what else is queued, kb/Work PB3107, PB3123) and hands
  the branch to GitHub's merge queue
  (`enqueue.py queue`: the PR titled from the DEVLOG entry, its body the entry and the commits; the queue's merge commit
  keeps the branch's commits ancestors of main). Main takes only queued pull requests, so while `ruleset.py check` does
  not report the queue ACTIVE it refuses before merging or gating anything. Every run ends on one `=== ENQUEUE: ` line:
  run it in the background and block on that line. Exits: 4 conflict (before or after the gate) · 5 a gate not GREEN ·
  3/6/7 a landing check · 8 the queue not ACTIVE · 9 GitHub refused · 11 unreviewed. ⓜ 2026-10-10 under the trains: 233 of 567 lander minutes (41 %) were local whole-population gates, 94 more
  the former direct-push landing holding main while CI ran the same population, 10 landers for 6 trains, the first commit on main 6 h
  49 min into the day (kb/Work PB3015).
- **Who runs it.** While the orchestrator loop runs (`python scripts/orchestrator/coord.py loop-state` prints `LOOP
  STATE: running`), its LANDING LANE (`scripts/orchestrator/land_lane.py`, ticked by the supervisor beside every
  unit, kb/Work PB3103) runs it for every branch `python scripts/prune_worktrees.py --brief` lists WAITING TO LAND,
  in the order it lists them (the most harmful lead first, kb/Work PB2981's ranking), the moment it is ready; the
  `enqueue` unit (`scripts/orchestrator/units/enqueue.md`) reviews, dispatches finishers and files the leads; the attended session lands by hand only what the lane cannot reach or would leave idle
  for a mechanical reason (O11, "nothing simple waits", owner 2026-10-24), and writes each finished attended branch that needs a review as a report
  where the unit collects it — the file name EXACTLY `<coord>\scratch\reports\w<wave><letter>-PB<lead>-report.md`
  (plan_wave.py `REPORT_NAME`), its header:

  ```
  Status: DONE
  Worktree: E:\COBOL\.claude\worktrees\<name>
  Branch: <branch>
  HEAD: <sha>
  Base: <sha>
  ```

  `prune_worktrees.py --brief` lists it WAITING FOR REVIEW until ONE read-only `cobol-reviewer` stamps it (the `review`
  skill's branch form, MANDATORY-PRACTICES I10, kb/Work PB3027); a `Review: CLEAN` stamp at its tip makes it WAITING TO
  LAND. With the loop STOPPED the attended session runs `enqueue.py land` by hand for its own branch, no agent needed.
- **What a script cannot decide goes to ONE finisher (L12).** A conflict (exit 4), an untested tip (14: no recorded GREEN local gate covers it), a red gate (5), a DEVLOG or oracle
  refusal (6, 7), or a pull request the queue BOUNCED or whose required check failed before the queue
  (`prune_worktrees.py` reads ENQUEUED, NOT QUEUED and BOUNCED from `queue_facts.py`, the one reader of GitHub's facts;
  offline the states are git-only) is the branch's own: one
  `cobol-finisher` with `templates/finisher-brief.md` fixes it at the root, gates and returns DONE; its commits are reviewed on the branch (I10) before `enqueue.py land` takes the new tip (an unreviewed tip is exit 11).
  Exit 3 (the landing check's STOP) is never retried as is: the landing lane retries it at the same head only once
  `landing_check.py` passes on the branch; exit 12 (GATE BUSY: another gate held the worktree's gate lock, the
  branch's own gate is still running and has not written its verdict, or the gate's Linux half found a Linux gate of the
  tree running; nothing ran, nothing is red) is no stop either: the lane retries it once the lock is free and no Linux
  gate of the tree runs (kb/Work PB3527, PB3662, PB3649); exit 15 (PREDECESSOR
  QUEUED: the branch merged a predecessor whose pull request is still open, so it carries that pull request's stamped
  DEVLOG entry beside its own, nothing queued, nothing red) is the same: the lane retries it once no open pull request
  owns an entry the branch carries (kb/Work PB3145); exit 13 (another
  `land` of the branch holds the worktree's land lock, kb/Work PB3310) is the same: nothing ran, the lane retries it
  once the lock is free. A gate NOT RUN (it
  measured nothing) goes by its cause's class in `run_gate_legs.NOT_RUN_CAUSES` (kb/Work PB3526): an ENVIRONMENT cause
  (malformed gate settings, a host with no WSL, Python or SDK) is exit 2 with no BLOCKED line, retried once and a second
  time the operator's handoff; a BRANCH cause (code the gated tree carries failed: the driver, the population listing,
  no verdict line) is measured on main at the same step, and blocks like a red (exit 5, a finisher's) unless main fails
  the same way (then exit 2, the operator's).
  After `ENQUEUED` the
  lane's QUEUE WATCH follows the pull request into the merge queue: a NOT QUEUED pull request past the grace gets a
  re-run of its stuck check, then a close, reopen and re-queue, then a mailbox question to the operator. A stop resolved with no new commit is landed again only when the enqueue
  unit re-arms it (`land_lane.py rearm <branch> --why ...`, kb/Work PB3103). A permission refusal of `enqueue.py land` is handed off,
  never retried or routed around: `READY-TO-LAND <worktree> <branch>` (L13).
- **No landing takes a lease: the merge queue orders main (kb/Work PB2537, PB3023 review R1-1, PB3024).** Main
  refuses a direct push (the ruleset binds administrators), so every waiting branch is enqueued at once and main moving
  under a gate is merged in by the script. The direct-push landing script, the landing lease that serialized it and its
  `ci/` landing branches are deleted (kb/Work PB3024's closing change; `LandingPipelineDriftTests` keeps them out).
- ⛔ **No branch is left undecided (MANDATORY-PRACTICES O10, owner 2026-10-08, kb/Work PB2600).** After every landing,
  `python scripts/prune_worktrees.py` (the lifecycle survey) then `--apply`, which deletes the LANDED branches; a branch
  that will not land is ABANDONED by a line in its kb/Work note (the word ABANDONED directly after the branch's name, then the reason) and
  then `--apply --abandon <branch>`. Nothing is archived (owner 00:52: "Archiving to a bundle serves no use and wastes
  disk space").
- ⭐ **A free implementer slot is filled within the TURN it frees** — mechanically, by the rolling wave (§2,
  `templates/wf_rolling_wave.js`), whose queue is filled from `fix_clusters.py` — never at the next convenient moment. ⓜ The fix lane ran at **under 15 % utilization** of the ≤3 cap for six days
  (~2.7 mechanisms/day delivered against ~24/day of capacity) purely because slots sat empty behind landings and
  behind the evidence lane. Keep a standing queue of apply-ready contracts so the dispatch is one turn.
- A worktree-isolated agent cannot run git against the shared checkout (the harness refuses `-C`, `cd`, EnterWorktree):
  `enqueue.py land` works in the branch's own worktree, and the orchestrator removes dead worktrees itself with
  `python scripts/prune_worktrees.py --apply` (never a hand `git branch -D`: the survey's classification is the only
  thing that tells a landed branch from unlanded work, O10).
- ⛔ **NOTHING REACHES `main` BUT A TESTED TREE, AND THE SERVER ENFORCES IT.** `main` carries a REQUIRED status check —
  `ci-gate`, the terminal job of the workflow — enforced for administrators (every push here is made with the owner's
  credentials, so a rule that spares administrators spares everyone; owner decision 2026-09-06, question 23). Through the
  merge queue, `ci-gate` runs on the merge group, and a red bounces only the pull request that caused it (the merged
  commit's own `push` run then finds that green run on its sha and skips the matrix). A red is a BLOCKING finding attributed by job / step /
  failing test, fixed on its branch. **The local gate runs on ONE Windows host plus WSL; CI's runners are the other
  hosts — a test that depends on host ACL or file-lock semantics is not proven until CI is green.** ⓜ main was red for
  29 h across 16 consecutive completed runs (2026-09-05/06) while every landing in that window reported a green
  Windows-only gate and nobody looked (`kb/Work/PB796`).
- ⚠ **A docs-only landing still runs — and still has to be green.** `paths-ignore` is GONE from the workflow (it
  made the workflow decline to START, which a required per-commit check reads as "blocked forever"); the `changes`
  job now decides whether the MATRIX runs from the same path list, so a landing touching only `DEVLOG/`,
  `docs/**`, `kb/**`, `PROMPT.md`, `CLAUDE.md` or `README.md` finishes in seconds. "No run for my sha" is no longer
  an answer — it is a failure.
- Verdict batches are RE-APPLIED on the merged tree (`record_verdicts.py`), never merged as inventory JSON hunks.
- ⛔ A checkpoint file never enters a landing: every landing `git add` excludes it —
  `git add -A -- . ":!.claude/settings.local.json"` then `git reset -q -- STATUS.md`; ⛔ **not** `":!STATUS.md"`
  inside the pathspec, because STATUS.md is gitignored and `git add` EXITS 1 AND STAGES NOTHING when a pathspec
  item matches only an ignored path (measured 2026-09-06, git 2.55.0) — the form written here until now skipped
  the whole checkpoint for anyone who did not read its exit code. A lander that rebases onto a main that
  already carries a stray `STATUS.md` removes it (`git rm --cached STATUS.md`) in its commit. (2026-09-02: lander 3's
  checkpoint reached main inside a landing, and the next lander's rebase then had to choose between two agents'
  checkpoints for one path.)
- ⛔ **`git stash` IS FORBIDDEN IN THIS REPO — WIP GOES INTO A COMMIT.** The stash stack lives in the COMMON git
  directory (`git rev-parse --git-common-dir` → `E:\COBOL\.git`), so it is SHARED by every linked worktree:
  `git stash list` run from an isolated implementer worktree shows the other agents' entries and `stash pop` takes
  `stash@{0}` whoever pushed it. PB713's implementer ran `… && git stash pop -q` after a `git stash push` that had
  created nothing (its file was untracked), so the pop consumed the REGISTRAR's stash; it was restored with
  `git stash store`, and DEVLOG Entry 155 records the same shape ending worse ("Never `git stash` while background
  agents are writing files … Lost all 7 completed agents' work"). Commit WIP on your own worktree branch — that is
  what the checkpoint protocol is for — and to compare against a clean tree add a detached worktree
  (`git worktree add --detach <path> <sha>`), never stash/build/probe/pop.
- The GPL GnuCOBOL corpus (`tests/external/gnucobol`) is git-ignored and **per worktree**. The gate (`scripts/run_gate_legs.py`) fetches it
  when absent (train 23), so a fresh implementer or lander worktree measures the population from its first gate;
  `ExternalCorpusPopulationDriftTests` is RED BY DESIGN without it (`kb/Work/PB209`). ⛔ **The two population reds are NOT
  "the known worktree shape" any more** (`kb/Work/PB897`): the fetch was broken on every host whose PATH `tar` is GNU tar —
  it deleted the corpus and then failed to extract — so those reds were permanent and everyone was told to ignore them.
  The fetch now stages and swaps, tries each `tar` it can find, and prints one `FETCH FAILED: <cause>` line; a failed fetch
  makes the gate RED with `EXTERNAL CORPUS FETCH FAILED, POPULATION UNMEASURED` on the verdict line. **Without that line
  the population reds are a real red** — attribute them, never wave them through.
- Read-only fleets probe a **pinned worktree with its own built compiler** (`git worktree add --detach <path> <sha>`,
  build there once) so no landing swaps a binary under them.
- One comprehensive battery per landing batch, run by the orchestrator when no fleet is live — ⭐ **in a WORKTREE cut
  at the batch head**, never on main. Its phase 2 (`guard-fast`) REBUILDS, so a battery on main freezes the lander
  for ⓜ ~45 min ≈ 1.5 landings ≈ 7 clusters; run it in a detached worktree at the batch's head commit and that cost
  is zero. The cadence does not change — ⓜ a bisect over N landings costs ⌈log₂N⌉ battery runs, and neither of the
  last two non-green batteries needed one (both reds were attributed by inspection).
- **The owner's ledger artifact is refreshed after EVERY landing that moves GAP / DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT / the
  actionable count, and at every battery close** (owner reminder 2026-09-02): `python scripts/spec/gen_ledger.py
  --out <html>` then an `Artifact` publish to the existing URL (recorded in the orchestrator's memory
  `conformance-ledger-artifact`). Every number is computed by the generator, never typed, and nothing on the page is
  hand-written (the in-flight narrative was removed, kb/Work PB2912): its top block is WHAT REMAINS to v1.0, and its
  trend series (`<coord>/ledger-trend.json`, never in a checkout: kb/Work PB2426) gains a point whenever GAP or the
  register's defect series moves. **Do it in the same turn as the landing report, once per landed train, not once a day** (owner
  2026-10-04: trains 1011 and 1012 had landed with no refresh). The generator back-fills one trend point per
  inventory-moving commit since the series' last point (`missed_points`), so a missed refresh costs nothing but
  a stale page. The first publish after an unseen live version is refused with that version's source; publish the
  same file again unchanged and it goes through. **After every publish run `python scripts/orchestrator/ledger_state.py
  mark-published`**; the orchestrator's supervisor prints `LEDGER PUBLISH OWED` after any unit while the page's stamp is
  newer than the marked one, because a headless unit has no Artifact tool and only renders `{COORD}\ledger.html` (owner
  2026-10-04: "Publish ledger each time"; DESIGN-orchestrator-loop.md section 14).
- `python scripts/semgrep/verify.py` has a recorded red baseline (`kb/Work/PB175`): a landing must not INCREASE it.
