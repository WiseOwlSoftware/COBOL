      *> kb/Work PB1099 Q1 - the SOURCE phrase of the RECORD KEY and ALTERNATE RECORD KEY clauses at its
      *> provisional introducing edition COBOL-2002 (VCR row 7.36; constructs.json record-key-source-2002;
      *> below 2002 it is COBOL0900, negative pb1099-record-key-source-85). Annex A.3 item 40 makes the
      *> capability processor-dependent; this implementation provides it.
      *>   cite.py --check 12.4.5.12.4 "Record-key-name-1 defines a record key consisting of the
      *>     concatenation of all occurrences of data-name-2 in the order specified" -> OK 12.4.5.12.4 2)

      *> The prime key IX-PK is IX-B then IX-A - the REVERSE of their order in the record - and the
      *> alternate key IX-AK is IX-D then IX-C, WITH DUPLICATES. The alternate clause omits the optional
      *> words KEY and IS (12.4.5.6.2: only ALTERNATE, RECORD and SOURCE are underlined).
      *> EXPECTED OUTPUT, DERIVED FROM THE RULES:
      *>   W1 00 / W2 00   REC1 (key ZZ01, alt 2X) and REC2 (AA02, 1Y) are released.
      *>   W3 02           REC3 (MM01, alt 2X) duplicates REC1's alternate key, which WITH DUPLICATES
      *>                   permits (12.4.5.6.4 GR4); 9.1.13.2 item 2 c) reports it '02'.
      *>   W4 22           REC4 has IX-A = 01 like REC3 and IX-B = ZZ like REC1: its CONCATENATED prime
      *>                   key ZZ01 equals REC1's (12.4.5.12.4 GR1/GR2), so the WRITE is refused '22'.
      *>   N1 00 REC2 / N2 00 REC3 / N3 00 REC1 / N4 10   sequential READ by the prime key orders the
      *>                   records by the concatenation IX-B IX-A: AA02 < MM01 < ZZ01, then at end.
      *>   R1 00 REC1      READ KEY IS IX-AK with IX-D IX-C = 2X: of the two records whose alternate key
      *>                   is 2X, the first released (14.9.30.4 GR32).
      *>   R2 00 REC2      READ KEY IS IX-PK IN IXF (8.4.2.2.2 Format 6) with IX-B IX-A = AA02.
      *>   R3 23           READ KEY IS IX-PK with QQ01: no such key, invalid key.
      *>   S1 00           START KEY IS > IX-AK with IX-D IX-C = 1Y: the alternate key becomes the key of
      *>                   reference (14.9.41.4 GR16) and the first key > 1Y is 2X.
      *>   S2 02 REC1 / S3 00 REC3 / S4 10   READ NEXT on the alternate key: the duplicates in release
      *>                   order (14.9.30.4 GR26); the first is followed by a duplicate, so '02' (GR27).
      *>   L1 00 REC3 / L2 00 REC1   START KEY IS = IX-PK WITH LENGTH 2 with IX-B = MM: the first 2
      *>                   characters of the concatenation are IX-B (14.9.41.4 GR17 a)/b)), so REC3; READ
      *>                   NEXT continues on the prime key.
      *>   D1 00 / F1 00 REC3   DELETE with IX-B IX-A = AA02 removes REC2 (14.9.10.4 GR3); START with no
      *>                   KEY phrase (GR15: EQUAL on the prime record key) on MM01 finds REC3.
