      *> kb/Work PB1099 Q1 - ANSI X3.23-1985 prints RECORD KEY IS data-name-1 and ALTERNATE RECORD KEY IS
      *> data-name-1 only; the second key form, record-key-name-1 SOURCE IS { data-name-2 } ... (ISO
      *> 12.4.5.12.2 / 12.4.5.6.2), is a post-1985 form on the provisional 2002 edge (VCR row 7.36, derived:
      *> Annex E lists no 2014->2023 change for it, and the 2002/2014 split is not derivable in-repo). Both
      *> clauses share the one grammar rule and the one gate, so each SOURCE phrase draws COBOL0900 at 85;
      *> the positive is the suite test pb1099_record_key_source.
