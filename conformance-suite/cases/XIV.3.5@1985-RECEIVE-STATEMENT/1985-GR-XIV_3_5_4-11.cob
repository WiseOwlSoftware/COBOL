      *> §1985:XIV.3.5.4 GR11 (THE RECEIVE STATEMENT). An output test:
      *> the program must translate and run at 85 and DISPLAY exactly
      *> the lines its .out holds, the outcome the rule requires. Placed
      *> from the confirmation pass's redraft (WEAK original) by
      *> scripts/spec/place_witnesses.py (kb/Work PB4995).
      * X3.23-1985 XIV 3.5.4 general rule 11: END-RECEIVE ends the
      * RECEIVE statement, so the statement after it is no part of a
      * phrase.
      * The program first defines its queues, sources and
      * destinations to this implementation's message control
      * system (the file mcs.json of the MCS directory).
