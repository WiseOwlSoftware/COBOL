## Entry 2115 — 2026-10-16 15:17 PDT — PB1099 Q1: the RECORD KEY / ALTERNATE RECORD KEY SOURCE phrase is provided (a record key is a list of byte windows)

kb/Work PB1099 (wave 1095, group I). The owner rule R65 (2026-09-30) classified Q1 — Annex A.3 item 40, the
`record-key-name-1 SOURCE IS { data-name-2 } …` key form of §12.4.5.12.2 / §12.4.5.6.2 — as a processor-dependent
element this processor CAN provide, so the COBOLNET1954 refusal (kb/Work PB358) had to become the feature.

**Re-probe.** On the w1095i build `negative/pb358-record-key-source` drew COBOLNET1954 at 85, 2002 and 2023, as
the note said.

**The mechanism — one key shape.** §12.4.5.12.4 GR2 / §12.4.5.6.4 GR2: "Record-key-name-1 defines a record key
consisting of the concatenation of all occurrences of data-name-2 in the order specified" (`cite.py --check` OK on
both). Every layer that carried a key as ONE contiguous byte window now carries a LIST of windows end to end, and
data-name-1 is the one-window case rather than a separate path (the shape kb/Work PB293 recorded as the cost):
- `FileModel.RecordKey` (the resolved key: segments, record-key-name, `CategorySource` for §12.4.5.12.3 SR5 /
  §12.4.5.6.3 SR6), `RecordKeySource` / `KeySourceOperand` (the phrase as written); `PrimeKey` replaces
  `RecordKeyItem`, `AlternateKeys` carries `RecordKey`s, and `RecordKeyClauseWritten` is gone (both forms name the
  clause now). `DataBinder.CaptureRecordKeySource` is ONE capture for both clauses; `ResolveFiles` resolves each
  data-name-2 by data-name-1's SR2 selection.
- Runtime: `KeySegment` (offset, length, layout); `IndexedConnector.KeyOf` concatenates through the one slice;
  `RegisterIndexed` / `AddAlternateKey` take `KeySegment[]`; `FixedFileAttributes.KeyDescriptor` holds the segment
  list (value equality); the store header is FORMAT VERSION 5 (each key's segment count and windows — §12.4.5.12.4
  GR3 makes every window a fixed attribute). A version-4 store is Foreign ('39'). The changed public members make
  this an incompatible runtime surface, so the runtime MAJOR is raised 6 → 7 (Directory.Build.props; main's PB442
  had already raised it 5 → 6 for its own surface change) and `RuntimeAbiPinDriftTests` re-pinned: a module compiled
  against runtime 6 is refused by `RuntimeAbi.Skew` rather than failing inside a key registration.
- `FileControlKeyRules` yields ONE OPERAND PER data-name-2, so every rule stated of "data-name-1 and data-name-2"
  (SR1, SR2, SR3, the minimum-size rule) reaches each through the data-name-1 row; new rows for SR2's last sentence
  ("All occurrences of data-name-2 shall be of the same category") on both clauses; §12.4.5.6.3 SR4's SOURCE
  exemption is now `CoincidingKey`'s first test; the clause-level rows ask only the clause's first operand.
- Naming the key: `FileModel.RecordKeyNameCandidates` (with §8.4.2.2.2 Format 6's one file-name qualifier) is the
  ONE lookup READ … KEY (§14.9.30.3 SR11), START … KEY (§14.9.41.3 SR7; GR15/GR17 b) through
  `BoundKeyedStart.NamedKey`) and COLLATING SEQUENCE OF (§12.4.5.7.3 SR5) ask, as a COUNTED set; another file's
  record-key-name is refused naming the rule. The data-item arms (`RecordLayout.KeyIndexAtOffset`, START SR6 b) 1. "defined without
  the SOURCE phrase") pass over a SOURCE-form key. SORT/MERGE GIVING an indexed file (§14.9.40.3 SR9) compares a
  SOURCE-form prime key only when its windows are one run. The EXTERNAL file fingerprint (§12.4.5.3 GR1 j)/k))
  carries each data-name-2's entry.
- Edition: a post-1985 form gated ONCE on the shared grammar rule, `record-key-source-2002` (VCR row 7.36, a
  derived provisional 2002 edge — Annex E lists no 2014→2023 change, X3.23-1985 prints data-name-1 only).
  COBOLNET1954 is RETIRED (a retired code stays retired); `QualifiedNameClasses`' qualified-record-key-name row is
  Resolved.

**Goldens.** `conformance:2002/pb1099_record_key_source` — a prime key written in the REVERSE of record order and a
duplicate alternate key in the optional-word minimum spelling: the concatenated uniqueness '22', the sequential
order AA02 < MM01 < ZZ01, READ KEY on both keys (one Format-6 qualified), START > on the alternate (02 then 00 in
release order), START WITH LENGTH 2 on the concatenation, DELETE, and START with no KEY phrase; every expected line
derived from the cited rules in its header. `conformance:negative/pb1099-record-key-source-85` (COBOLNET0900 at
85). `FileControlKeyRuleSpecTests`' SOURCE section replaces the decline tests: the spellings compile from 2002,
each data-name-2 rule reports once at its operand, SR11/SR7/SR5's other-file refusals, and the complement. The
five `negative/pb358-*-source*` decline witnesses are removed; ~20 runtime unit tests take the `KeySegment[]`
registration.

**Register.** PB1099 → landed. Batch `w1095i-pb1099-record-key-source` re-verdicted 19 rows: SR-12.4.5.12.3-5,
SR-12.4.5.6.3-6, GR-12.4.5.12.4-2, GR-12.4.5.6.4-2 and SR-14.9.41.3-7 DOCUMENTED-NON-SUPPORT → CONFORMS;
SR-12.4.5.7.3-5 is now tested (the `DRV-SR-12.4.5.7.3-5` derivation, whose antecedent was "no accepted program can
declare a record-key-name", is withdrawn); the rest gained witnesses and lost the retired ones. The
`record-key-source-only` derived-verdict selector is withdrawn. Q3 (§8.13 external repository) is carried by
kb/Work PB1086 and its slices, which already claim DOC-A.1-161/162. Docs: CONFORMANCE.md §2 row 40 Claimed,
COBOLNET_FILES_DESIGN.md "THE SECOND KEY FORM" and D10 (format version 5), the grammar's comments, README.

**Branch review, round 1 (three findings, all fixed by the review finisher).**
- R1-1: `DataBinder.CollatingKeyNamed`'s one-fault-one-verdict guard took `AlternateKeyClause.Item is null` to mean
  "unresolved", and `Item` is always null for the SOURCE form, so `COLLATING SEQUENCE OF AK IN IXG` (IXG another
  file) compiled clean and the clause was dropped. `FileModel.DeclaresUnresolvedKeyNamed` now holds the guard: a
  SOURCE clause is unresolved only when one of its operands is, and matches only under Format 6's qualifier. The
  probe draws COBOLNET1582 (§12.4.5.7.3 SR4/SR5).
- R1-2: the record-key-name lookup returned the FIRST match, the kb/Work PB978 shape. A record-key-name declared by
  two clauses of one entry (Format 6's only qualifier is the file-name both share) bound silently to the prime key
  (READ returned '23' on a stored alternate key). `cite.py --check 8.4.2.2.3 "For each non unique user-defined name
  that is explicitly referenced, uniqueness shall be established through a sequence of qualifiers that precludes any
  ambiguity of reference"` → OK 1). `RecordKeyNameCandidates` returns `NameCandidates<KeyNameReading>`, and the
  positions that admit data-name-1 OR record-key-name-1 (`KeyedIoBinder.RecordKeyNameOf`, `CollatingKeyNamed`)
  count every reading in one set — every visible file's record-key-names, and the data-name reading, since
  §8.3.2.2 rule 3 lets one word be both — for the one verdict, `UniqueOrReportAmbiguous` (COBOLNET1639). The
  sibling sweep found the same "asked first" order in both positions and the cross-file and data-name collisions,
  and all are now in the count. `NameCandidates` gained `Plus` and `Select`, still with no indexer.
- R1-3: five inventory rows still argued from the retired COBOLNET1954 decline. They were restated with evidence:
  GR-14.9.41.4-13 has a new golden `2002/pb1099_record_key_source_national`, where START LENGTH counts national
  positions across the SOURCE segments (LENGTH 3 crosses the IX-B/IX-A boundary, and each row is chosen so that a
  byte count would pick a different record). SR-12.4.5.12.3-4 has a new SR4 witness per data-name-2.
  GR-12.4.5.3-1 has the `ExternalFileEntryIdentityTests` j)/k) SOURCE rows and an operand-order row.
  SR-8.4.2.2.3-1 and FMT-14.9.41.2 were also restated. The deleted lookup was retired as a witness from
  SR-12.4.5.7.3-5 and SR-14.9.41.3-7.

**Branch review, round 2 (one finding, fixed by the round-2 review finisher).**
- R2-1: R1-2 counted the data-name reading through `ReferenceResolver.Probe`, which answers only a unique item. So
  the count went DOWN as same-spelled data items were added: one WORKING-STORAGE `RK` beside the record-key-name
  `RK` drew COBOLNET1639, and two (`RK` in `G1` and in `G2`) compiled clean with the READ bound to the SOURCE prime
  key. Measured on the merged build before the fix: `q1.cob` exit 0, `q0.cob` two SR1 errors. `cite.py --check
  8.4.2.2.1 "No other name has the identical spelling"` → OK 1). `KeyedIoBinder.RecordKeyNameOf` now adds every
  `DataBinder.QualifiedCandidates` survivor (the set the data-name resolution counts) to the `KeyNameReading` set;
  `q1.cob` draws COBOLNET1639 with 3 declarations on the READ and the START, `--permissive` warns. The SR1 theory
  gained the DATA2 rows and now asserts each refusal's declaration count. `CollatingKeyNamed` already counted
  `QualifiedCandidates`, so it had no such hole. SR-8.4.2.2.3-1's notes were restated (batch
  `w1095i-review-r2-pb1099`; CONFORMS, GAP 78 → 78). The merge of main brought PB2758's runtime surface change under
  this branch's major 6, so the runtime surface hash was re-pinned (21C3F112DD1E124B).
- Landing finisher (Linux gate RED, characterization): the branch raised the runtime major to 6 but never
  re-recorded the 14 emitted-C# characterization snapshots, which stamp the runtime version in
  `[assembly: CobolRepository(…)]` and `EnsureRegistered`; they were red on both hosts, but the Windows gate's leg 1
  never planned them (a version is reached by no test through code impact, and the impact map was absent), so only
  the landing's whole Linux run saw them. Meanwhile main's PB442 raised the major 5 → 6 independently, so the merge
  of main raises this branch's change to 7 and re-pins the merged surface (1EDF6BEDACF395D8), each landing's
  incompatible change getting its own major as PB442 did over PB651. The root fix: `EmittedCSharpSnapshotTests`
  snapshots the version stamp as `{RUNTIME-VERSION}`, substituted only where it equals `RuntimeAbi.Version`, so a
  major bump no longer touches the snapshots (four earlier finishers each re-recorded all 14 for one bump, to 3, 4, 5
  and 6; an emitter stamping any other version still diffs, and `TheEmittedRecord_StatesTheVersionsThisRuntimeDeclares` pins the exact text).
  DESIGN-test-build-ci.md gate 3 says so.
- Landing finisher (merge-queue bounce, `merge_conflict` with PR #139): PB2099's .NET host surface reached main at
  major 6 with its own re-pin (a `callerPath` nullability relaxation on `CallProgram` and `Cancel`, which kept the
  major; its boundary-layout re-pin covers the host-entry classes). The two sides touch disjoint lines of
  `PublicAPI.Shipped.txt`, which merged cleanly; this branch's removed members still raise the combined surface to
  major 7, the boundary hash is main's (this branch never moves it), and the test recomputed the combined runtime
  surface hash (E13EE8199764F780).
- Landing finisher (Linux gate red, exit 5 on `a9bc43263`): `RegionLocksDriftTests.TwoWaitingHoldsBothGetTheByteInTurn(kind:
  LockFiles)` answered `[Unavailable, Ok]`. It was main's, not this branch's: 2 of 160 stressed WSL runs failed at the head and
  4 of 160 at origin/main, and the diff never reaches `IO/Sharing`. Root cause (kb/Work PB3313, measured): a lock directory a
  sibling had just made, removed by the sibling's CLOSE between .NET's `mkdir` (`EEXIST`) and its own existence check, made
  `Directory.CreateDirectory` throw out of `SidecarLockFiles.Publish` into `Hold`'s `catch (IOException)`. All 14 non-Ok
  rounds of 24,000 in a first-chance harness were that `EEXIST`. `HostFile.CreateLockDirectory` now reads `EEXIST` with
  nothing left at the name as the closing-sibling race and lets `Publish` retry it, as .NET answers it on Windows. After the
  fix the harness met no `EEXIST` in 248,000 rounds. One hold still answered `Unavailable`, by a rarer mechanism: all eight
  `Publish` attempts failed to create their pending file. That one is not yet root-caused and is kb/Work PB3314 (open).

**Self-review.** Architecture: one key shape, one capture, one lookup, one gate; no C# text in a bound node.
Code: each cited rule re-read for the operand it names (data-name-1 vs data-name-2, record-key-name-1). Performance:
the one-window key keeps its single-slice path; only a multi-window key allocates its concatenation. Duplication:
`KeyWindow` (the emitter's per-item window reader) is reused per segment rather than copied.
