/// ⛔ THE CHARACTER POSITIONS OF A FORMAL'S STORAGE THE ACTIVATED ELEMENT REFERENCED AS A RECEIVING ITEM (kb/Work PB2690).
/// <para>ISO §8.5.1.9.3: "When a data item in a dynamic-capacity table is referenced as a receiving item and the value of
/// the subscript exceeds the current capacity of the table, a new element is automatically created and the capacity of the
/// table is increased to the value given by the subscript." A BY REFERENCE formal whose table has a FIXED occurrence count
/// opposite the argument's dynamic-capacity table occupies the argument's storage (§14.2.3 GR8: "the activated runtime
/// element operates as if the formal parameter occupies the same storage area as the argument"), so a store through its
/// occurrence past the argument's capacity is exactly that receiving reference. When the pair's shapes differ the formal
/// occupies a fresh area filled from the argument and stored back at return (<c>CobolArgAdapt.Area</c>), and the image
/// stored back cannot tell a store of exactly the image the formal was shown from no store at all. So the area records
/// the reference itself: every store through a view of a pointer-located class notes its window on the area's cell
/// (<see cref="StorageCell.Received(long, int)"/>), the boundary starts the record once the area is filled
/// (<see cref="ManagedPointer{T}.Watch"/>), and the write-back reads it here.</para>
/// <para>⛔ THE COORDINATES ARE THE FORMAL'S STORAGE, the positions of its area's cell: for a variable-length formal that
/// is its fixed run WITH each dynamic-capacity table's one-element reservation in place (<c>CobolVarGroup</c>'s
/// <c>Geometry.StorageAt</c>), never the fixed run alone (<c>Geometry.FixedChars</c>, which <c>StorageCell.RunOf</c> cuts
/// the reservations out of). A reader indexing this record by fixed-run offsets would read an occurrence shifted by every
/// reservation before it.</para>
/// <para>⛔ AN OCCURRENCE OF THE FORMAL'S OWN DYNAMIC-CAPACITY TABLE IS A SCOPE OF ITS OWN (kb/Work PB2690 branch review
/// round 1 of wave 1078 A, finding R1-1): its element lies in an element cell whose positions and component ordinals start
/// again at zero, so a fixed table nested in it (opposite a dynamic-capacity table nested in the argument's element) is
/// recorded in that occurrence's own record, keyed by the component ordinal and the occurrence number its store
/// reached (<see cref="StorageCell.Received(ReadOnlySpan{long}, long, int)"/>), and read back through
/// <see cref="Element"/>. The key is the SUBSCRIPT, never the element cell: an occurrence the callee's own receiving
/// reference creates is a new cell, and its references are recorded all the same.</para>
