/// ⛔ THE ONE FAILURE OF LOCALE-COLLATION RESOLUTION (kb/Work PB2773): the collation DATA a locale resolves through
/// cannot be used — a site CLDR file (<c>COBOL_CLDR_DIR</c>) or <c>.tailor</c> file (<c>COBOL_COLLATION_DIR</c>) that
/// is malformed, unreadable, written for another UCA version, or that asks for more than the builder can number.
/// Every data problem on the resolution path raises THIS type, at the boundary where the data is read or applied:
/// <see cref="Cldr.CldrLocaleLoader"/> (parsing a CLDR file), <see cref="TailoringRules"/> (parsing a <c>.tailor</c>),
/// <see cref="CollationTable.WithTailoring"/> (a stale <c>@version</c>) and <see cref="Cldr.CldrTailoringBuilder"/>
/// (numbering). A problem with ONE rule of a CLDR collation is not a failure of the locale: the builder skips the rule
/// and lists it in <see cref="ResolvedLocaleCollation.Unsupported"/>.
/// <para>The consumers each turn it into their defined outcome, never a crash: <see cref="CollationEngine.ResolveLocale"/>
/// records it as <see cref="ResolvedLocaleCollation.Failure"/> over the root order (the nearest available order);
/// <see cref="CollationEngine.TryGetOrderingTable"/> answers false with its message (the compiler's COBOL1662
/// warning, EC-ORDER-NOT-SUPPORTED at run time, §15.85.4 r2); <see cref="CollationEngine.IsKnownLocale"/> answers
/// false (the locale is not available in this operating environment); <see cref="Locale.LocaleManager.GetLocale"/>
/// throws it to its host caller; and <see cref="CollationRuntime.Warmup"/> reports it as its Warning.</para>
