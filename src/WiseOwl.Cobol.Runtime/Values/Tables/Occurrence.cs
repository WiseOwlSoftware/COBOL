/// ⛔ AN ORDINAL POSITION THAT MAY LEAVE <c>long</c> READS AS THIS — AN OCCURRENCE NUMBER (kb/Work PB2695) OR A
/// REFERENCE-MODIFIER LEFTMOST POSITION OR LENGTH (kb/Work PB2938): the <c>long</c> every accessor positions by, plus —
/// only when the item's value left <c>long</c>'s range — the value itself, for the diagnostic.
/// <para>The narrowing to <c>long</c> SATURATES (<see cref="CobolNum.Position(Int128)"/>): ISO §8.4.2.3.4 GR2 — "If the
/// value of the subscript is not a positive integer or is less than one or is greater than the highest permissible
/// occurrence number, the EC-BOUND-SUBSCRIPT exception condition is set to exist" — needs an out-of-range subscript to
/// stay out of range on the way in, and §8.4.3.3.4 rule 5 says the same of a reference modifier ("a value that
/// references a position outside the area of identifier-1"). The saturated <c>long</c> is therefore right for every
/// decision and wrong for the one thing a message must name: the value the program holds. The detail text of
/// <see cref="CobolTable.At{T}(T[], Occurrence)"/> printed <c>9223372036854775807</c> for a <c>PIC 9(21)</c> subscript
/// holding 10^20 + 1, and <see cref="CobolString.RefMod"/> printed <c>2147483647</c> for the same item as a leftmost
/// position. The exact text rides WITH the position instead of beside it (a thread-static "last wide value" slot would
/// be hidden state that any later unrelated narrowing could leave stale), so the one reader that raises is handed the
/// one value it must print.</para>
/// <para><b>A wide carrier's <c>CobolTable.Occ</c> / <c>CobolString.RefModPosition</c> returns this; a narrow one
/// returns the plain <c>long</c>.</b> Both convert to each other implicitly, so a consumer that only positions (an
/// OCCURS DEPENDING group extent, a record length) takes a <c>long</c> parameter unchanged, and a consumer that RAISES a
/// position condition takes the <c>Occurrence</c> overload. The exact text exists only at the two saturation extremes
/// (a value inside <c>long</c> prints as the <c>long</c> itself), so an in-range position pays one null reference and no
/// allocation. The name is the subscript's, the first consumer: a reference modifier's position is an ordinal position
/// of the same kind, and a second carrier type would be a second copy of this rule.</para>
