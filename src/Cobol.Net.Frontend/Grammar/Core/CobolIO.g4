// ==========================================
// INSPECT (§14.9.22 — COBOL-85)
// ==========================================

// identifier-1 admits a FUNCTION-IDENTIFIER, but only in Format 1 (PB10). §8.4.3.1.2 Format 1 makes a
// function-identifier an IDENTIFIER, so every identifier-N position admits one unless a syntax rule excludes it —
// and §8.4.3.2.3 SR1 excludes it from a RECEIVING operand. INSPECT is FORMAT-DEPENDENT here, which is why the
// grammar cannot decide it alone: identifier-1 is SENDING only in Format 1 (TALLYING). §14.9.22.4 GR1 concedes
// only that "for purposes of determining its length, identifier-1 is treated as a sending data item" — a scoped
// concession that would be unnecessary if it were generally sending — and GR7 has each match "tallied (format 1)
// or replaced by literal-3 (format 2)", while GR20 makes format 4 execute AS a format 2 over the same
// identifier-1. So Formats 2/3/4 MODIFY it and bar a function-identifier. ⛔ THE BINDER SCREENS PER FORMAT
// (InspectBinder, COBOLNET1632); widening the grammar alone would ACCEPT ILLEGAL SOURCE.
// ⛔ ADDITIVE — an ALTERNATIVE, never a rewrite to a shared rule: this grammar is shared with the legacy
// CobolSharp.Compiler until the P15 cut-over, and collapsing the rule would DELETE the generated
// .dataReference() accessor its binder reads. The legacy binder guards on the new null instead.
