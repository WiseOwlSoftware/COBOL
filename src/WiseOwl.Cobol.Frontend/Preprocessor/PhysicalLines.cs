/// <summary>
/// THE LINE-ENTRY STAGE of the reference-format pipeline (kb/Work PB1800): the one place where decoded source or
/// library text becomes LINES, so that the four determinations ISO §6.1 leaves to the implementor are each written
/// exactly once and every later stage (the Auto format detector, the directive scan, the fixed-form and free-form
/// converters) reads the same lines.
/// <list type="number">
/// <item><b>Terminators</b> (docs/CONFORMANCE.md DOC-A.1-156; §6.1 3) b) "The implementor shall specify any control
/// characters that terminate a free-form line"): a LINE FEED ends a line, and a CARRIAGE RETURN immediately before it
/// is part of that terminator. A lone CR — one not followed by a LINE FEED — is an ordinary character of the line (the
/// GnuCOBOL reader's rule, <c>ppinput</c>; rule-1 precedence). The end of the text ends its last line, so a text with
/// <c>n</c> LINE FEEDs has <c>n</c> + 1 lines.</item>
/// <item><b>Tabs</b> (DOC-A.1-157; §6.1 1) c) "The implementor shall specify the meaning of lines and character
/// positions"): a horizontal tab U+0009 advances to the next tab stop — positions 1, 9, 17, 25, …, a position being one
/// CHARACTER and not one UTF-16 unit (<see cref="CharacterPositions"/>, kb/Work PB1966) — and is replaced by
/// the one to eight spaces that fill the gap, EVERYWHERE, an alphanumeric literal included (owner decision, kb/Work
/// R55: the tab is an input-medium positioning control, not a character of the literal; <c>X"09"</c> is how a
/// program puts a TAB in data). No tab survives this stage, so no later stage has a tab rule. A line that held a tab
/// or a supplementary-plane character keeps a <see cref="ColumnMap"/> from each expanded index to the character
/// position the file holds it at, which is the ONE column unit every diagnostic is named in (kb/Work PB2983).</item>
/// <item><b>Archive markers</b> (kb/Work PB1803): the NIST CCVS archive-control lines <c>*HEADER,…</c> and
/// <c>*END-OF,…</c> that delimit members of <c>newcob.val</c> are blanked — and ONLY when the CCVS dialect is on
/// (<c>--nist</c>), because they are never valid COBOL and in any other compilation a column-7 <c>R</c> or a free-form
/// word must be diagnosed, not discarded. A marker becomes an EMPTY line, so the line numbering is untouched.</item>
/// </list>
/// Nothing outside this type splits raw text on line ends, trims a CR, or looks for a tab
/// (<c>PhysicalLinesDriftTests</c>). The free-form 255-position limit (§6.1 3) a)) is asked where a line is read as
