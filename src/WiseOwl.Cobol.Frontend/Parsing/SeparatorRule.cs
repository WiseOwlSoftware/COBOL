/// <summary>
/// ⭐ THE §8.3.5 SEPARATOR-CONTEXT RULES, decided once over the whole token stream from the SOURCE CHARACTERS around
/// each token (kb/Work PB1394):
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>rule 2 — "The COBOL characters comma and semicolon, immediately followed by a space, are separators": a comma
/// or semicolon with no space after it is no separator, so <c>MOVE 1 TO N,M</c> names no second receiver
/// (<c>COBOL2631</c>);</item>
/// <item>rule 3 — "The COBOL character period, when followed by a space, is a separator": <c>DISPLAY N.DISPLAY M</c>
/// ends no sentence (<c>COBOL2632</c>);</item>
/// <item>rule 5 — "The opening delimiter shall be immediately preceded by a space, left parenthesis, or opening
/// pseudo-text delimiter. The closing delimiter shall be immediately followed by one of the separators space, comma,
/// semicolon, period, right parenthesis, or closing pseudo-text delimiter": <c>DISPLAY "AB"N</c>, <c>MOVE"AB" TO A</c>
/// and <c>W"AB"</c> beside a data item W (<c>COBOL2633</c>);</item>
/// <item>the three operator clauses that state their OWN separator context — §8.7.1 "[the arithmetic operators are
/// COBOL characters] that shall be preceded by a space and followed by a space except that no space is required
/// between a left parenthesis and a unary operator or between a unary operator and a left parenthesis", §8.7.3 "The
/// concatenation operator is the COBOL character '&amp;', which shall be immediately preceded and followed by a
/// separator space" and §8.7.4 "The invocation operator is the two contiguous COBOL characters '::', which shall be
/// immediately preceded and followed by a separator space": <c>SPACE&amp;SPACE</c>, <c>O:: "M"</c>, <c>O ::"M"</c>,
/// <c>1*2</c>, <c>(A)+(B)</c> and <c>-Y</c> (<c>COBOL2993</c>; kb/Work PB1430, PB2017). §8.7.3 and §8.7.4 are asked
/// by <see cref="Violations"/> over the token stream; §8.7.1 by <see cref="ArithmeticOperatorViolations"/> over the
/// parse tree, because only the tree says whether a <c>+</c> or <c>-</c> is a binary operator, a unary operator or
/// no operator at all (a numeric literal's own sign, a <c>LINE PLUS</c> screen clause).</item>
/// </list>
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>⛔ WHY POST-LEX, FROM THE CHARACTERS, AND NOT IN THE GRAMMAR. The lexer skips the separator space, so the
/// parser sees the same token run whether or not a separator was written — <c>N,M</c> and <c>N, M</c>, <c>"AB"N</c>
/// and <c>"AB" N</c> are indistinguishable by the time any rule could ask. Every one of these rules is about the
/// CHARACTER next to a token, and the token's own source indices say exactly where that is, so the decision is made
/// here, once per token, for every statement and entry at once — the check that used to exist only as the parser's
/// recovery hint on the few statements whose parse the split happened to break ("Missing space before string
/// literal"). It is the sibling of <see cref="PictureSeparatorPeriodRule"/>, which decides the §13.18.40.3 SR7
/// question at a PICTURE string's right edge the same way, and it is reported through the same listener.</para>
/// <para>⚠ THE SPACE-LESS COMMA OF A NUMERIC LITERAL IS NOT THIS RULE'S. Under DECIMAL-POINT IS COMMA the comma is a
/// numeric literal's decimal point (§12.3.7.4 GR14 a)), and the lexer delivers <c>1,5</c> as INTEGERLIT COMMA
/// INTEGERLIT for the parser to assemble (a list region's signed <c>-1,5</c> is one SIGNED_DECIMALLIT token, kb/Work
/// PB2506, so no COMMA token reaches this rule for it); whether that literal is legal is the numeric-literal rules' question (the
/// binder's one normalizer reports a comma decimal point without the clause). So a comma touching a following digit,
/// with a digit or a separator before it, is left alone here. A semicolon is never a decimal point.</para>
/// <para>⚠ A PERIOD, COMMA OR SEMICOLON INSIDE A LITERAL OR A PICTURE CHARACTER-STRING IS PART OF THAT TOKEN, never a
/// DOT / COMMA / SEMICOLON token, so rules 2 and 3 cannot misfire on one ("except when appearing in a literal", and
/// the PICMODE lexer owns the picture's own separators). A <c>;</c> with no space after it is a HIDDEN-channel token
/// (<c>SEMICOLON</c>) precisely so this rule can see it; the parser never does.</para>
/// <para>⚠ ONE REPORT PER BOUNDARY. An operator touching a literal breaks two rules at one boundary — §8.3.5 5) for the
/// literal's delimiter and §8.7.3 / §8.7.4 for the operator. The operator's clause is the specific one (it names the
/// very character that touches), so the operator reports the boundary and the literal's delimiter check stands down
/// for it: <c>O ::"M"</c> is one COBOL2993, never a COBOL2633 beside it.</para>
/// <para>Edition-invariant: §8.3.5's text, and COBOL-85's, carry no edition qualifier; §8.7.3 and §8.7.4 qualify no
/// edition either (the operators themselves are 2002 introductions, which <c>VersionConformancePass</c> gates on
