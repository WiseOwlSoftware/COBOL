/// <summary>
/// THE ONE PLACE A CLOSED GENERAL FORMAT'S RESIDUE IS REFUSED BY NAME (kb/Work PB829) — a sibling to
/// <see cref="DeclinedFacilityPass"/>, run right after it from <c>BinderDriver</c>.
///
/// <para>WHAT IT CLOSES. <c>genericClause : IDENTIFIER (IDENTIFIER|literal)*</c> matches ANY run of words, so
/// wherever it sat in an alternative list it was a TOTAL SINK for everything the named alternatives missed. The
/// grammar called it a "vendor/extension hook" and reached it from SIX sites spanning EIGHT closed general
/// formats. It is not a vendor hook: a vendor extension is admitted only under the dialect that owns it, never by
/// a catch-all, and this compiler declares no vendor dialect. What it did was swallow — at every edition and
/// every strictness, with no diagnostic anywhere, so §4.2.2's warning obligation ("An implementation shall
/// provide a warning mechanism … to indicate violations of the general formats and the explicit syntax rules of
/// standard COBOL") could not be met for a construct the compiler never represented.</para>
///
/// <para>WHY ONE PASS AND ONE TABLE, NOT EIGHT DIAGNOSTIC SITES. Closing it one site at a time is how it
/// survived: kb/Work PB487 closed §13.16.2 and its sibling sweep, reading the grammar by rule NAME, counted four
/// of the remaining five and missed the I-O-CONTROL paragraph's INLINE alternative, which is not a named
/// <c>xxxClause : genericClause</c> wrapper. The grammar now has ONE error production
/// (<c>unrecognizedClause</c>), this pass is its ONE consumer, and <see cref="ClosedFormats.ByContext"/> is its
/// ONE table — which the parse layer reads too, for the residue the production cannot hold: a RESERVED word at its
/// position is refused by <c>CobolErrorStrategy</c> with the row's own code and sentence (kb/Work PB2533); <c>ClosedFormatDriftTests</c> derives the obligation from the .g4 files and from the generated
/// parser, in BOTH directions, so a new closed format cannot parse into silence and a stale row cannot linger.
/// Adding a closed format is `| unrecognizedClause` plus a table row — no code here changes. (The pass owns one
/// more error production of the same posture, <c>misplacedSpecialNamesForPhrase</c> — a known phrase written in a
/// position no format prints; see <see cref="VisitMisplacedSpecialNamesForPhrase"/> — and the punctuation half of
/// three paragraph formats, their separator periods, read through <see cref="ParagraphPeriods"/>; see
/// <see cref="ScreenParagraphPeriods"/>.)</para>
///
/// <para>WHY A PARSE-TREE WALK AND NOT A BINDER HOOK — the <see cref="DeclinedFacilityPass"/> argument, and here
/// it is load-bearing rather than convenient. The §13.16.2 refusal used to live in <c>DataBinder.BindEntry</c>,
/// which is NOT reached for every written entry: the level-66 and level-88 paths return before it, so an
/// unrecognized word on <c>88 CN WIBBLE VALUE 1.</c> was dropped in silence by the very fix that closed the
/// format — MEASURED on the pre-change build, where only COBOLNET1747 fired and WIBBLE vanished. Four of the
/// other seven formats have no binder entry point at all — an unrecognized
/// CONFIGURATION SECTION or IDENTIFICATION DIVISION paragraph binds nothing by construction. A walk over the
/// parse tree sees the written syntax whether or not anything binds it.</para>
///
/// <para>SEVERITY. Error at every edition and every strictness, through <see cref="EditionContext.Error"/> and
/// not the declined/removed seam: this is not an optional element this implementation declines (§4.2.7) nor a
/// construct of another edition (§8.9) — it is source no edition of the standard admits, and there is no
/// permissive reading of it that is not "compile something the programmer did not write".</para>
