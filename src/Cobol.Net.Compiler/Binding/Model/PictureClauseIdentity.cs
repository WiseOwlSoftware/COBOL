/// <summary>
/// ⛔ WHAT "THE SAME PICTURE CLAUSE" MEANS — the ONE identity every identical-description rule of the standard
/// compares (kb/Work PB1166). Five clauses demand that two elementary descriptions have "the same … PICTURE …
/// clauses" and qualify it with the same two exceptions: §8.5.3.1 (type equivalence), §9.3.6 3) (method matching),
/// §9.3.8.2.3 rules 3/6 (interface conformance, overrides and IMPLEMENTS), §14.8.2.3.2 rule 2 (BY REFERENCE
/// arguments) and §14.8.3.3 (returning items):
/// <list type="bullet">
///   <item>"Currency symbols match if and only if the corresponding currency strings are the same" — so the
///   identity carries the currency STRING (<see cref="CurrencyString"/>) and the character-string carries the
///   symbol canonicalized to <c>$</c>: <c>CURRENCY "USD" WITH PICTURE SYMBOL "U"</c> + <c>PIC U9.99</c> is the
///   same PICTURE clause as <c>"USD"</c> under the symbol <c>$</c>, and <c>"EUR"</c> under <c>$</c> is not.</item>
///   <item>"Period picture symbols match if and only if the DECIMAL-POINT IS COMMA clause is in effect for both
///   … or for neither of them. Comma picture symbols match if and only if …" — so the identity carries the
///   DECIMAL-POINT IS COMMA state of the source element that declared the item (<see cref="DecimalPointIsComma"/>),
///   but ONLY when the character-string has a period or comma symbol: a picture without one is the same clause
///   under either setting, and the rule speaks only of those two symbols.</item>
/// </list>
/// <para>Both facts are properties of the SOURCE ELEMENT, not of the character-string, which is why a raw
/// character-string compare missed them: a CLASS definition and a program in one compilation group each carry
/// their own SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph (§12.3.7.4 GR1 makes a CONTAINED unit inherit, so the difference is reachable
/// exactly across separately-defined units). The measured consequence before this type existed: a class returning
/// <c>PIC Z9,99</c> under DECIMAL-POINT IS COMMA into a non-DPC <c>PIC Z9,99</c> receiver compiled clean, and the
/// receiver read 1234 for the 12.34 the sender meant.</para>
/// <para>The <see cref="CharacterString"/> is the EXPANDED character-string (repetition factors unrolled, letters
/// uppercased — §8.1.3.2 GR3 a) makes a picture symbol case-insensitive), so <c>PIC X(3)</c> and <c>PIC XXX</c> are
/// one clause while <c>PIC A(5)</c> and <c>PIC X(5)</c> — equal in length and in storage — are two.
/// <see cref="Editing"/> is the resolved PICTURE EDITING phrase set (§13.18.40.2 Format 1), part of the clause.</para>
/// <para>Computed ONCE, by <c>PictureAnalyzer.Analyze</c> — the one place the character-string, the unit's
/// CURRENCY SIGN set and its DECIMAL-POINT IS COMMA state are all in hand — and carried on
/// <see cref="PicInfo.Clause"/>. Being a value-equality record it is part of <see cref="PicInfo"/>'s own record
/// equality, so the §8.5.3.1 profile compare (<c>StrongTypeModel</c>) and every activation and signature relation
