/// ⛔ THE ONE "same signature" TEST over two prototypes (kb/Work PB817). The standard writes that sentence
/// TWICE, in adjacent syntax rules of one statement, over two carriers:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>ISO §14.9.39.3 SR20 — "The function-prototypes associated with identifier-12 and identifier-13 shall
/// have the same signature." (SET Format 8, function-pointer-assignment.)</item>
/// <item>ISO §14.9.39.3 SR22 — "If identifier-7 references a restricted program-pointer, identifier-8 shall be
/// the predefined address NULL or shall reference a program-pointer and the program-prototypes associated with
/// identifier-7 and identifier-8 shall have the same signature." (SET Format 9.)</item>
/// </list>
/// The only difference is which namespace resolves the prototype NAME, which the caller has already done, so
/// the RULE is written here once. It is also the rule §13.18.60.4 GR25/GR26 state as the carriers' standing
/// invariant, and §14.8.2.3.2's "if either is a restricted pointer, both shall be restricted and of the same
/// type" screens the argument-passing edge of it.
/// <para><b>What "the same signature" means here, derived.</b> The standard's §3 terms do not define the word;
/// Annex D.9.3.2 does, informatively — "all explicit or implicit prototype information that exists for the
/// specified function is applicable to the function identified by the address". The prototype information a
/// COBOL prototype carries is its PROCEDURE DIVISION header: the positional USING formals (their descriptions
/// and their passing modes, §14.8.2) and the RETURNING item (§14.8.3, whose §14.8.3.1 makes its very presence a
/// conformance fact — "if and only if"). So this compares exactly those, position by position, through
/// <see cref="OoConformance.SignatureDifference"/> — the ONE pair-mode relation over two descriptions
/// (<c>ActivationRelations.SignatureDifference</c>) that the override, IMPLEMENTS, interface and property-accessor
/// checks ask too, so a description rule cannot mean one thing here and another there (kb/Work PB3101) — and, for an
/// alphanumeric group, through its subordinate entries as well (<c>SameDescription</c>).</para>

/// — "the details are taken from the external repository" — and this implementation's external repository is the
