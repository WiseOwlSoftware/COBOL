/// §14.2.3 GR8 makes the formal "occupy the same storage area as the argument" and that storage has a fixed
/// window. A VARIABLE-LENGTH group has no such window, so a flat string cannot be inverted: the receiver
/// cannot tell where a dynamic member's content ends and the next fixed member begins. This carrier is the
/// §8.5.1.12 model made into a wire form, and nothing more:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><see cref="Fixed"/> — the group's image with every variable-length component contributing NOTHING.
/// §8.5.1.12.3 says "all dynamic-length elementary items are considered to be of zero length" and makes a
/// matched dynamic-capacity table "the length of a single element", which is exactly the byte accounting under
/// which compatible groups have the SAME relative positions. So both sides lay this string out identically as
/// far as their fixed material agrees, and any tail difference is the §14.8.2.2 rule-1 size latitude, absorbed
/// by the ordinary width window.</item>
/// <item><see cref="Dynamic"/> — each variable-length component's CURRENT content, in declaration order:
/// a dynamic-length elementary item's characters, a dynamic-capacity table's occurrences concatenated at its
/// current capacity. §8.5.1.12.2's positional correspondence puts the two sides' components in the same order,
/// one for one, which is why an ordinal array is a faithful carrier and not an encoding trick. The receiving
/// table recovers its capacity by dividing by its own element width — legitimate because §8.5.1.12.3 makes
/// corresponding tables match only when "the byte length of their elements is equal".</item>
/// </list>
/// <para>NESTING is flattened by the emitted composer, because §8.5.1.12 is stated over relative byte positions
/// and is blind to the declaration tree: a nested variable-length group contributes its own fixed run and its

/// <para>⛔ ONE SHAPE IS NOT FLATTENED — A DYNAMIC-CAPACITY TABLE WHOSE ELEMENTS ARE THEMSELVES VARIABLE-LENGTH GROUPS
/// (kb/Work PB2496). Its occurrence count is a run-time quantity and each occurrence holds components of its own, so

/// ONE component, and its occurrences' own carriers ride beside it in <see cref="Elements"/>: §14.6.9.2 moves it
