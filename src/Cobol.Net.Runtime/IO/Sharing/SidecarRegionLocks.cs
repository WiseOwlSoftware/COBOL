/// ⛔ THE REGION LOCKS OF A HOST WITH NO OPEN-FILE-DESCRIPTION LOCKS — macOS above all (kb/Work PB2936). ISO §9.1.16:
/// <i>"While locked by a given file connector, a record is not accessible to another file connector in the same or a
/// different run unit"</i>; §9.1.13.8 1): the access answers I-O status 51. Before this class a record lock and the
/// store mutex of a shared RELATIVE or INDEXED file had no expression off Linux and Windows, so two run units sharing
/// such a file under <c>SHARING WITH ALL OTHER</c> both read '00' for a record one of them held, wrote over each other's
/// store and lost updates, silently.
/// <para><b>The mechanism is <see cref="SidecarLockFiles"/>'s, with a different NAME.</b> A "byte" is held by publishing a
/// lock file in the physical file's lock directory — the one <see cref="SidecarColumnLockHost"/> publishes its columns
/// in — named <c>r&lt;offset as 16 hex digits&gt;-&lt;S|X&gt;-&lt;guid&gt;</c>: the byte, the mode (<c>S</c> shared,
/// <c>X</c> exclusive) and a name no other holder shares. (⛔ A WIRE VALUE: two runtime versions must find each other.)
/// Classic <c>fcntl</c> record locks cannot stand in: they belong to the process and are dropped when ANY descriptor the
/// process holds on the file closes, so a second connector's CLOSE in the same run unit would release the first's locks;
/// and <c>fcntl</c> is variadic, which Apple's arm64 ABI passes differently from a fixed P/Invoke signature.</para>
/// <para><b>Publish, then test, as <see cref="RunUnitFileLock"/> does.</b> A hold publishes its file and then looks for
/// another LIVE holder of the same byte that conflicts with it — any holder for an exclusive hold, an exclusive holder
/// for a shared one — skipping only its own file. Two exclusive requests at the same instant cannot both pass, because
/// whichever completes its publication second finds the first; both may be refused (each saw the other), which is a
/// refused statement and not a violated lock, and a waiting request retries after a jittered pause, so one of them
/// goes through. A refused or unavailable hold leaves no file behind.</para>
/// <para><b>Dead holders refuse nobody, and holders this process cannot observe refuse everybody.</b> A file whose
/// lock nobody holds is a killed run unit's leftover and is swept by whoever finds it; a file the process may not open
/// is <see cref="HostFile.LockFileState.Unobservable"/> and is neither (kb/Work PB2917): a non-waiting hold reports it
/// <see cref="RegionLockResult.Held"/>, and a WAITING one reports <see cref="RegionLockResult.Unavailable"/> because it
/// cannot wait for a release it cannot see — the run unit then has only its own protection for that statement, the
/// same degradation a directory it may not write has. A lock directory this user may enter but not LIST hides every
/// holder in it and is unobservable as a whole (the train 1056b review: read as a lock the host cannot hold, it gave a
/// READ WITH LOCK the record §9.1.13.8 1) refuses with '51').</para>
/// <para><b>Release and close.</b> A released byte's file is deleted before its descriptor closes
/// (<see cref="SidecarLockFiles.LockFileHolder"/>), the endpoint's disposal releases every byte it still holds, and a
/// run unit that is killed holds nothing — the kernel dropped its locks with its descriptors.</para>
