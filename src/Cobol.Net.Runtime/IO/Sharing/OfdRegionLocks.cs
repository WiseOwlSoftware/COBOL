/// and nothing else (kb/Work PB833). The policy that uses it — WHICH columns a connector publishes and tests — is
/// <see cref="RunUnitFileLock"/>'s, spoken to this host by <see cref="OfdColumnLockHost"/>; this class is only the
/// host's words for "hold a shared lock on byte N" and "does anybody ELSE hold one on byte N". A host whose process
/// shape it was not written for (<see cref="Available"/> false: macOS, any other Unix) is served by
/// <see cref="SidecarColumnLockHost"/> instead (kb/Work PB2484).
/// <para><b>Why these locks and not .NET's.</b> .NET on Unix maps every <see cref="FileShare"/> but
/// <see cref="FileShare.None"/> onto ONE advisory <c>flock</c> <c>LOCK_SH</c>, which admits another run unit's
/// writer under every posture but NO OTHER; <c>FileStream.Lock</c> takes a classic <c>F_SETLK</c> lock, which the
/// kernel keys on the PROCESS and drops when ANY descriptor the process holds on the file closes — and this
/// runtime opens and closes bookkeeping handles on a connector's file all the time. An open-file-description
/// lock belongs to the one descriptor that took it: it conflicts with every other descriptor, in this process or
/// another, and it dies with that descriptor alone. That ownership is also what the test needs, because
/// <c>F_OFD_GETLK</c> never reports a lock the asking description holds itself, so a connector can publish its
/// own presence FIRST and then ask whether anybody else is there (<see cref="RunUnitFileLock"/>).</para>
/// <para><b>Capability is measured, not assumed (kb/Work PB795).</b> Nothing here switches on the platform
/// beyond the ABI constants below, which are a per-host fact asked in ONE place (the
/// <see cref="HostFile.IsSharingRefusal"/> pattern). Whether the host actually carries the locks is what the
/// first <c>F_OFD_GETLK</c> says: <c>EINVAL</c> (a kernel before 3.15, or a host whose <c>fcntl</c> number 36 is
/// something else), <c>ENOLCK</c>/<c>EOPNOTSUPP</c> (a filesystem without byte-range locks) and a missing
/// <c>libc</c> (Windows, where <see cref="FileShare"/> is mandatory and per-access already) all answer
/// <see cref="RegionLockResult.Unavailable"/>, and the connector then has exactly the file lock its <see cref="FileShare"/> gives.
/// The constants are the Linux x86-64/arm64 values and <c>struct flock</c> is the 64-bit layout; any other
/// process shape is <see cref="RegionLockResult.Unavailable"/> without a call being made.</para>
