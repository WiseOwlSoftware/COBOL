/// ⛔ THE LOCK-FILE PRIMITIVE OF EVERY HOST THAT HAS NO OPEN-FILE-DESCRIPTION LOCKS — macOS above all (kb/Work PB2484,
/// PB2936): ONE LOCK FILE PER HOLDER, in a lock directory BESIDE the physical file, published atomically and probed
/// without excluding any other prober. <see cref="SidecarColumnLockHost"/> (the §9.1.15 file lock) and
/// <see cref="SidecarRegionLocks"/> (the §9.1.16 record locks and the store mutex) are two POLICIES over this one
/// mechanism, so the rules that make it race-free are written here and nowhere else.
/// <para><b>The directory.</b> <c>.wolk-&lt;16 hex&gt;</c>, named by the SHA-256 of the physical file's name under the
/// host's case rule (<see cref="HostFile.PhysicalFileKey"/>), so two spellings of one file reach one directory and two
/// runtime versions find each other. It is created with the permissions of the physical file's directory
/// (<see cref="HostFile.CreateLockDirectory"/>) and its files carry the directory's read and write bits
/// (<see cref="HostFile.OpenLockHolder"/>), so a second user who may use the physical file's directory can publish into
/// it and read the first user's files (kb/Work PB2917).</para>
/// <para><b>A holder is a file whose lock is held.</b> The file is held open through a <see cref="FileStream"/> that
/// takes an exclusive advisory lock (<see cref="HostFile.OpenLockHolder"/>); a prober asks for a SHARED one
/// (<see cref="HostFile.ProbeLockFile"/>), refused exactly while the holder lives. The kernel drops the lock with the
/// descriptor, so a run unit that is killed holds nothing and its file reads <see cref="HostFile.LockFileState.Dead"/>.
/// No native call is made: <c>fcntl</c> is variadic, which Apple's arm64 ABI passes differently from a fixed signature,
/// and its open-file-description commands are private there.</para>
/// <para><b>Publication is atomic.</b> A holder creates and locks <c>pending-&lt;guid&gt;</c>, checks the lock is really
/// in force, and only then RENAMES it to its final name (a rename keeps the open file description, hence the lock). A
/// tester reads only final names, so a file it can open freely is dead or being closed, never half-published, and it
/// deletes it, which keeps a crashed run unit's litter from growing. A pending file it can open freely it deletes too;
/// a publisher that loses that race publishes again.</para>
/// <para><b>Probing never excludes a prober</b> (kb/Work PB2917): holders are exclusive and probes are shared, so two
/// run units sweeping one dead file at the same instant both open it, and neither reads the other as a holder — the
/// reverse (exclusive probes) refused a request '61' for a connector that did not exist.</para>
/// <para><b>Capability is measured, not assumed (kb/Work PB795).</b> The lock .NET takes is advisory, absent on a network
/// file system and switched off by <c>DOTNET_SYSTEM_IO_DISABLEFILELOCKING</c>; right after creating its file a holder
/// probes it and, if the probe is NOT refused, the host cannot hold the lock here and <see cref="Publish"/> answers null
/// — as it throws for a directory the process may not write. The caller maps both to
/// <see cref="RunUnitFileLock.Outcome.Unavailable"/> (or its region equivalent).</para>
/// <para><b>No name a prober reads is ever deleted in place</b> (<see cref="Retire"/>): where share modes are mandatory
/// (Windows), a file deleted while another handle has it open stays listed, DELETE-PENDING, and every open of it is
/// "access denied" — the very answer an unobservable holder gives — until the last handle closes. So a lock file there
/// is first RENAMED to <c>gone-&lt;guid&gt;</c>, a name no tester probes, and only then deleted: a tester that listed the
/// old name reads <see cref="HostFile.LockFileState.Gone"/>, and "access denied" stays a decisive answer
/// (<see cref="HostFile.ProbeLockFile"/>). A Unix file is gone the instant it is unlinked, so there it is deleted.</para>
/// <para><b>The CLOSE.</b> The holder's file loses its name BEFORE its descriptor closes (a <c>fork</c> for
/// <c>CALL "SYSTEM"</c> holds a copy of the description until its <c>exec</c>, and a name nobody can see cannot refuse a
/// successor for those milliseconds, the window <see cref="OfdRegionLocks.Release"/> closes on Linux), and the directory
/// goes with its last file — by the same rule as the files: <b>the lock directory is never deleted in place either</b>
/// (<see cref="RetireDirectory"/>, kb/Work PB3109). Where share modes are mandatory it passes through DELETE-PENDING under
/// its own name for as long as any other handle on it is open, and a publisher's <c>CreateNew</c> inside it and a tester's
/// listing of it are then "access denied" — read as a directory this user may not write, so a waiting hold answered
/// <see cref="RunUnitFileLock.Outcome.Unavailable"/> and an OPEN a spurious '61'. So it is renamed away first.
/// <b>What it is NOT:</b> a lock on the file's inode — two spellings that reach one file through
/// a symbolic or hard link name two lock directories, the identity every table here uses
/// (<see cref="HostFile.PhysicalFileComparer"/>); and a program that takes no part in the protocol is not seen.</para>
