/// each of these functions is defined by an equivalent arithmetic expression evaluated in that same native
/// arithmetic. With a floating-point argument the EAE's own operands are binary64, so evaluating it in binary64 IS
/// the equivalent expression. Nothing exact is being given up: there was no exact value to preserve once the

/// ⛔ <b>THESE ARE NOT OVERLOADS, AND THE FIRST ATTEMPT PROVED WHY.</b> Sharing the F2 names looked ideal: the
