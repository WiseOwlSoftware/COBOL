#!/usr/bin/env bash
# linux-gate.sh — run CI's LINUX test legs locally, under WSL, before a push spends a CI run on them.
#
#   From any shell, at the tree's root:  bash scripts/linux-gate.sh [--legs unit,characterization,conformance,guard] [--nice]
#   On a host that is not Linux (Git Bash, PowerShell's bash) it runs ITSELF under WSL, in the same tree with the same
#   arguments, and its verdict is that run's (run_on_linux, kb/Work PB2999).
#   python scripts/self_tests.py runs `bash scripts/linux-gate.sh --self-test` (the host hand-off, with stand-ins).
#
# ⛔ WHY IT EXISTS (kb/Work PB1732). The implementer and lander gates ran on Windows only, so CI's Linux jobs were the
# first Linux run a change ever got. On 2026-09-28 train 71b's first push went RED in `Greenfield unit +
# characterization (Linux)`: group F's new GateLegDriftTests.Arm5 planted the Windows root `E:\COBOL-wt\battery87`,
# which `Path.GetFullPath` treats as RELATIVE on Linux. The unit leg reproduces exactly that one red; the CI round
# trip cost ~30 min and a dropped cluster. MANDATORY-PRACTICES I8 (implementers) and L10 (landers) require this
# script, check_practices.py refuses a brief without it, and LinuxGateDriftTests keeps its legs equal to what CI's
# Linux jobs run: every test project they `dotnet test`, and every repository script they `bash` (the `guard` leg,
# CI's guard job, added 2026-10-04 by kb/Work PB1955 after that job's red reached CI unseen).
#
# HOW: a LINUX CLONE OF THE COMMIT, never the Windows tree. The tree's committed HEAD is cloned (`--shared`: it
# borrows the Windows repository's object store read-only, so it copies nothing) into ~/linux-gate/<tree> on the
# Linux filesystem, built there with the Linux SDK, and tested there — the shape of CI's ubuntu jobs.
# Two earlier designs failed, each measured:
#  1. Running the Windows-built binaries: the Conformance tests find their goldens through [CallerFilePath], which a
#     Windows build bakes in as `E:\…` paths, relative on Linux — 363 false reds.
#  2. Running in the Windows tree with GIT_DIR/GIT_WORK_TREE exported so Linux git could read a Windows worktree
#     (whose `.git` file names an `E:/` gitdir): the variables reached EVERY test process, and a test that builds its
#     own scratch repository (gate_slot.py's self-test: git init, commit, worktree add) wrote into the REAL
#     repository instead — `core.worktree` landed in the shared E:\COBOL\.git\config and broke git for every
#     checkout until the owner removed it (2026-09-29, wave 72). So NOTHING here is exported: the only git calls on
#     the Windows repository are this script's own READS (`wgit`: HEAD, the git directory, the uncommitted-change
#     count, the tripwire), by the tree's own git and without optional locks (kb/Work PB2880), and the tests run in a
#     clone that is an ordinary Linux repository.
# The clone builds COMMITTED HEAD: commit before running it. Uncommitted tracked changes are counted and reported.
#
# Output: TestResults/linux-gate/<leg>.log (+ .trx, + <leg>.observations.log: the test harness's retries and
# non-observations) and build logs in the tree, one `leg <name>: GREEN|RED|NOT RUN`
# line each, and ONE verdict:
#   === LINUX GATE: GREEN (legs …) ===   |   === LINUX GATE: RED (…) ===   |   === LINUX GATE: NOT RUN (…) ===
# Exit 0 only on GREEN.

# ⛔ THE GATE PUTS ITSELF ON ITS HOST (kb/Work PB2999; owner 2026-10-11: "Why not simply require it to invoke using the
# proper host rather than an after the fact check that the correct host was invoked"). Started from Git Bash — the Bash
# tool every session has, and the bare command the gate skill gives — this script ran on WINDOWS: it cloned into the
# Windows home, built with the Windows SDK and printed `LINUX GATE: RED (... build ...)`, a verdict about no Linux leg at
# all. So on a host that is not Linux it runs itself under WSL (`-d Ubuntu`, the distribution scripts/wsl/ provisions),
# in this tree with these arguments, and exits with that run's status; the one refusal left is a host with no WSL.
# MSYS_NO_PATHCONV: Git Bash rewrites an argument that looks like a POSIX path before a Windows program sees it
# (`/mnt/e/...` became `C:/Program Files/Git/mnt/e/...`, DEVLOG), and the hand-off passes the arguments verbatim.
# `--exec`, not `--`: after `--`, wsl.exe hands the command line to the distribution's default shell, which parses it
# again — measured 2026-10-11, `-- bash -lc '... "$@"' linux-gate --legs unit --nice` reached bash as `[/bin/bash][]`,
# every argument lost; `--exec` gives bash the arguments as they are: `[linux-gate][--legs][unit][--nice]`.

#    interop) with its Windows path, against the stat data it wrote itself: 0.1-1.2 s;
#  - a tree on a Linux filesystem (a cloud session, a CI-like host) is read by Linux git, as any Linux checkout;
#  - both pass `--no-optional-locks`, so a read never refreshes the index of the repository it reads.
# Each arm reports git's paths in this shell's form (`wpath`): the clone below reads the object store through it.
