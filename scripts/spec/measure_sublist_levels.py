"""Measure, on the printed PDF, the LEVEL of every catalog sub-list — and record it as data the extractor checks.

WHY A SUB-LIST NEEDS A MEASUREMENT (kb/Work PB55, owner decision 2026-08-08 "THE RULE IS THE UNIT"). A rule
block's catalog rows are its TOP-LEVEL numbered rules; a numbered list printed INSIDE a rule — "GR 9 c) 1. 2. 3."
— is that rule's body, addressed by citation path, never a row. `extract_rule_catalog.py` tells the two apart by
the transcription's indentation, and the transcription flattened 51 such nested lists onto column 0, where each
became an `L<sublist>.<n>` row of its own: 152 sub-item FRAGMENTS in the denominator, decided by a transcriber's
indentation, not by the standard. Indentation in the markdown cannot settle which column-0 list is which — a
nested list flattened at a page break and a list the standard really prints at the margin look the same — so the
answer is a MEASUREMENT of the printed page, like `measure_index_levels.py`'s.

WHAT IS MEASURED. For each sub-list (catalog rows with `sublist` > 1) the printed line of its OPENING item is
located on the clause's pages and its ordinal glyph's x0 is set against that page's own left margin: the body
margin is the leftmost line start in the body band (63.49 pt on an even page, 80.04 pt on an odd one), and each
nesting level sits 17.5 pt further right (`a)` at +17.5, a list under `a)` at +35). Level 0 is a list the
standard prints at the block's own margin — a PEER list, introduced by its own prose lead-in ("The size error
condition exists in the following cases:", §14.7.5), whose items are rules in their own right. Anything deeper
is a flattened nested list and must be indented in `specs/ISO_COBOL.md`, never recorded.

`--write` records the measurement in `scripts/spec/data/sublist-levels.json`, which is committed so that
`extract_rule_catalog.py --check` can hold every sub-list to it in the public repository and in CI, where the
licensed PDF is not available: a sub-list nobody measured, or one measured deeper than level 0, FAILS the check.
