"""THE WORK REGISTER — one note per work item under `kb/Work/`, and the only place work is authored.

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS. "What is left to do" was authored in FIVE places, each in a different format, and three of
them declared themselves canonical:

    docs/COBOLNET_REARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md §0 NEXT   "the ONLY live-state SSOT"      buried in 3,614 lines
    docs/rearchitecture/CONFORMANCE-FIX-QUEUE.md   owns its own LANDED tally       2,484 lines of prose
    kb/Remaining Work Tracker.md                   "the canonical remaining-work tracker"   5 days stale
    §11 analysis backlog                           17 analyses                     inside the plan
    the queue's RESIDUE bucket                     ~10 findings                    prose, never itemised

When three artifacts each claim to be the source of truth, none is — and the cost was measurable: the residue
findings include a WRONG-ANSWER defect (`EXCEPTION-STATEMENT` returns `GO` where Table 12 requires `GO TO`) that
no work list could see, because it lived inside a paragraph.

⭐ THE FORM IS ONE NOTE PER ITEM, TRACKED IN GIT, WITH FRONTMATTER. Not one big JSON: a note gives Obsidian a
graph node (link an item to its spec clause and its code-reference note), gives git a per-item history instead of
a 2,484-line diff, and gives Bases every view without a query language. The forensic prose — repro, citation, why
a previous summary was wrong — lives in the note BODY, which is where it already was. Nothing is discarded.

    python scripts/spec/work.py migrate    # ONE TIME: fold the five registers into kb/Work/
    python scripts/spec/work.py check      # validate frontmatter; non-zero on a bad/missing field
    python scripts/spec/work.py next       # the ranked work list (session-probe prints this)
    python scripts/spec/work.py next --cluster PB2108 [--json]   # one campaign's open notes, tier then blocked_by order
    python scripts/spec/work.py stats      # counts by kind/status/harm
    python scripts/spec/work.py --self-test   # the frontmatter reader against tests/version-matrix/work-frontmatter-cases.json

⭐ `inventory_rows:` — THE BACK-LINK TO THE P14 TRACEABILITY INVENTORY, and the register's newest field
(2026-08-31). A note lists the `rule-id`s it owns; that list is the SSOT for ownership, and the note's prose
"Rows:" line is narrative beside it. It exists because the two artifacts answering "what is left to do" had
NOTHING holding them together: of 138 inventory rows verdicted PARTIAL / NOT-IMPLEMENTED / DIVERGES, **131 were
invisible to `next`** when it was first measured — ranked by nothing, owed by nobody, and counted by the
burn-down the whole time.

⛔ The field is checked against the inventory by `check` through `work_inventory.py` (this directory), which asserts
that every defective-verdict row is claimed by a note whose status is not terminal and that every claim names a row
the inventory has — so **flipping a note to `landed` without re-verdicting its rows turns the audit red**, which is
exactly the event that used to pass unnoticed. The predicate has to keep holding as the INVENTORY changes underneath a
note, which is why it is asked on every run of `check` (the gate's audit phase, CI's `audits` job) and not once at
landing. It was a Unit drift test until PB2878 (it read every note, which made `kb/` a test input).

⭐ `closes_rows:` — THE OTHER DIRECTION, and the register's newest field (owner decision 2026-09-19,
`kb/Work/PB245`). `inventory_rows` is what a note CLAIMS while it is open; `closes_rows` is what its landing
CLOSED, and it survives the landing. Without it, "which rows did this fix close" was answerable only by
re-measuring: fourteen §15 rows held the GAP open on mechanisms seven landings had already closed, and thirteen
closed CONFORMS the first time anyone looked. A landing therefore writes BOTH halves in the same change set —
the rows leave `inventory_rows` as they are re-verdicted, and they arrive in `closes_rows`. A landing that
closed no row says so with `closes_rows: []` **and** a `closes_rows_reason:`; silence is what the field
replaced. The spelling is `closes_rows`, not the decision's `closes-rows`: every multiword key in this
frontmatter is snake_case, and `kb/Work.base` addresses a property as `note.<key>`, where a hyphen would
at best need quoting and at worst read as an operator. Checked against the inventory by `work_inventory.py` (the
landed-note and the closed-row halves); the SHAPE half is :func:`closes_rows_shape` here.

⛔ AND THE READER ITSELF IS A GATE: `parse_frontmatter` is THE reader of the register — there is no second one — and
`--self-test` holds it to `tests/version-matrix/work-frontmatter-cases.json`, the shapes the register has contained, each
of which broke a reader once (`kb/Work/PB875`: a list WRAPPED across two lines was truncated here and discarded by the
C# twin that PB2878 deleted, and both called the note well-formed).

    `kb/Work/PB875` is the note recording what that cost: a list WRAPPED across two lines — the normal YAML shape, and
    the shape `kb/Work/PB205` had carried for months — was read here as a truncated list and in C# as NO list at

    none, and `work.py check` called the same note well-formed.

    note that claims nothing — the one answer a register must never invent. An unterminated list is now an ERROR

# ── clusters and the blocked_by topology (kb/Work PB2120) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# ⭐ A NAMED CLUSTER IS A PLANNABLE UNIT. `actionable` answers "what harms a user's program"; a campaign (the legacy
# retirement, the architecture review) is `process_only` work that ranks nowhere there, so it was dispatched by
# hand. `cluster:` names the campaign a note belongs to (usually its lead note's id, which may list itself) and
# `blocked_by:` orders the campaign. `cluster_order` is the ONE reader of both: `work.py next --cluster`,
# `plan_wave.py --cluster` and `next_unit.py` all call it, so "ready" means one thing everywhere.
#
# ⛔ `blocked:` IS A SECOND SPELLING OF `blocked_by:`, AND THEY DRIFTED. The fix lane skips a note whose flag is
# true (`.agent-fleet.json` skip_flag), so a flag left true after its blocker landed HIDES a live defect from every
# work list; two were found that way when this was written (PB1940 after PB2087 landed, PB1956 after PB322). So
# `check` holds the flag to the list: when `blocked_by` names notes, `blocked` is true exactly while one of them is
# still open. A flag with an empty list stays legal: it is a note blocked on something that is not a note.
#
# ⭐ `tier:` IS THE OWNER'S ORDER INSIDE A CAMPAIGN (kb/Work PB3423). `blocked_by` says what CANNOT start before
# something else; a tier says what SHOULD start first among notes that are all ready (PB3420: the owner's ten known
# SORT and file I/O defects before the rest of cluster PB3353, which the planner had ranked by inventory rows and harm
# alone). It is a list of `CAMPAIGN:N` entries, `tier: ["PB3353:1"]`, N a positive integer, 1 first, each naming a
# campaign the note's `cluster:` lists: SCOPED, because a note belongs to several campaigns (PB1278 to three) and the
# owner's order for one says nothing about another. In a campaign a note has no tier for, it ranks after every tiered
# note. `cluster_order` reads a note's EFFECTIVE tier, the lowest of its own and of every open cluster member it blocks
# (a tier-1 note's blocker is tier 1 too), so ranking by tier and then depth is still a blocked_by order, and
# `plan_wave.campaign_clusters` lifts its clusters the same way, so `work.py next --cluster` and the planner read one
# order. A held note (`status: owner`, a `blocked_by` hold) is still held: a tier ranks the READY notes, nothing more.
