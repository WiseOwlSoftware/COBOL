# ⛔ THE ONE PYTHON INTERPRETER a PowerShell gate entry runs: the pwsh twin of scripts/python-resolve.sh (kb/Work PB1637,
# PB3197). Dot-sourced, never run: `. (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'python-resolve.ps1')`, then `& $PY script.py …`.
#
# WHY A TWIN. The probe runs before any Python can, so it is written in the shell that starts the gate, once per shell:
# this file and python-resolve.sh probe the SAME candidates in the SAME order with the SAME floor probe, and
# PythonInterpreterDriftTests holds them equal. python-resolve.sh says why each candidate is PROBED by running it: a
# name on PATH is not an interpreter (on the Windows dev box `python3` is the Microsoft Store alias, which runs, prints
# "Python was not found" and exits non-zero).
#
# Nothing runnable ⇒ a TERMINATING error naming what was tried. A dot-sourced `exit` would end only this file and leave
# its caller running with no interpreter, so the refusal is thrown into the caller: build-local.ps1 reports its gate
# NOT RUN; any other caller stops with exit 1. A gate that cannot run its checks is never silently skipped.
# The version accepted is EXACTLY toolchain.env's PYTHON_VERSION (kb/Work PB4007), as in the bash twin.
