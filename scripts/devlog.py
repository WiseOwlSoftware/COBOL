"""devlog.py — THE DEVLOG IS ONE FILE PER ENTRY under DEVLOG/, and this is its one tool (kb/Work PB3025;
docs/rearchitecture/DESIGN-test-build-ci.md section 3.17.4).

    python scripts/devlog.py render [--since NNNN] [--out FILE]   the descending narrative (README, then newest first)
    python scripts/devlog.py stamp <branch> [--coord DIR] [--base origin/main]
                                                                   number and stamp the branch's pending entries as
                                                                   one (or re-stamp one main has overtaken); one commit
    python scripts/devlog.py check [--base origin/main] [--rev HEAD] the landing rule, on the trees of the range
    python scripts/devlog.py next                                  the highest entry number in DEVLOG/ (the allocator's floor)
    python scripts/devlog.py --self-test

THE SHAPE. `DEVLOG/README.md` is the front matter (what the log is, how an entry is written). Every entry is its own
file, `DEVLOG/NNNN-<slug>.md` (the number zero-padded to four digits, the slug from the title), whose FIRST LINE is its
header, `## Entry NNNN — YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ — Title`, followed by the body. Entries are LF text like every tracked
file (kb/Work PB3029). The narrative a reader wants is RENDERED, never committed: `render` prints the README and then
every entry, newest (highest number) first, by concatenating the files byte for byte; `DEVLOG.rendered.md` is the
gitignored place to put it. Why one file per entry: two landings that both insert at the top of one file collide, and a
merge queue bounces the second (owner 2026-10-11, kb/Work PB3015 Q2: "Yes, one file per entry"); CLAUDE.md rule 6 is
unchanged in substance — one entry per landing on main, newest first, the only history.

THE HISTORY (every entry of the monolithic DEVLOG.md, migrated byte for byte on 2026-10-11; DEVLOG/README.md names
the range, written by the migration itself) is looser than the rule for new entries: early headers carry no time,
some a `:` after the date, twelve a double-encoded dash; 1191a-1191d carry a letter; and twenty numbers were used
twice (008-014, 171-185). Each file keeps its header exactly; a number used
twice is told apart by a letter in the FILE NAME (`0185b-…` renders above `0185a-…`, as the monolith ordered them), so
the render order is the name order and needs no list. A NEW entry is held to the strict header and a plain number.

THE FLOW. The implementer writes `DEVLOG/pending-<slug>.md` whose first line is `## <Title>` (no number, no stamp) and
whose body follows. `stamp <branch>` runs when the branch is enqueued: it allocates the number through
`scripts/orchestrator/alloc.py devlog` (so number order is enqueue order is landing order), renames the file to
`NNNN-<slug>.md`, completes the header with the number and the current stamp, and commits that in the branch's
worktree. A branch that merged an unlanded predecessor (a same-file successor, a review finisher) carries that
predecessor's pending entry too and lands it, so `stamp` folds every pending entry into the ONE new entry, oldest
first (one landing on main, one entry). `check` is the landing rule (owner 2026-10-08, kb/Work PB2605: it covers "Only commits landing on main"),
run where every landing passes and on every pull request and merge group in CI.

WHAT `check` REFUSES (exit 1), on the committed trees of <base> and <rev>, never an index or a working tree:
  - a tree that still has the monolithic DEVLOG.md, a `pending-` file (an unstamped entry), or a DEVLOG/ file that is
    neither README.md nor an entry name;
  - an entry whose first line is not an `## Entry` header, whose header number disagrees with its file name, or whose
    number (with its letter) another file also holds;
  - a landing that adds no NEW entry, or more than one (new = a header line the base's history does not carry);
  - a new entry without the strict header, with a letter, or whose number is not above every number on <base> (a stale
    number after a rebase: re-stamp it);
  - a landing that deletes an entry <base> had: an entry FILE of <base> missing from <rev>, or, when <base> still has
    the monolithic DEVLOG.md (the one landing that migrates the log), a header line of it that no entry of <rev>
    carries, counted with multiplicity (the history repeats some headers).
Exit 0: the landing carries its one entry. Exit 2: the range could not be read (NOT RUN, never a pass).
