"""PreToolUse hook (matcher Agent|Workflow) — REFUSE a fleet dispatch unless the `workstream` skill was loaded in this
session, and refuse an implementer or finisher dispatch whose brief is not a checked, rendered spec or template.

Owner, 2026-09-30, after an orchestrator hand-wrote three implementer briefs from memory and skipped
.claude/skills/workstream/SKILL.md (MANDATORY-PRACTICES O9): "Reconfigure such that all future sessions cannot skip
learning this." A sentence in CLAUDE.md or memory was already there and was skipped, so the rule is structural:

  0. In a unit of the orchestrator loop (the supervisor exports COBOL_LOOP_UNIT), a Workflow call or an implementer or
     finisher Agent call is refused while the supervisor's wind-down signal <coord>/STOP-UNIT exists (kb/Work PB2597).
  1. Agent (cobol-implementer or cobol-finisher) and Workflow calls need a Skill call for `workstream` earlier in THIS
     session's transcript (or a /workstream command). The skill is what carries the mandatory practices.
  2. An Agent call for cobol-implementer or cobol-finisher must name, in its prompt, a RENDERED spec
     (`msg-w<wave>-<letter>.txt`, from make_dispatch_specs.py) or a brief under workstream/templates, and
     check_practices.py must print `=== PRACTICES CHECK: GREEN ===` over it. A hand-written inline brief is refused.

Read-only and mechanical roles (refuter, adjudicator, clerk, locator, Explore, general-purpose) pass rule 2; rule 1
applies to Workflow always. Exit 2 blocks the call and returns stderr to the agent. Anything unparseable passes (a
hook must never wedge a session), but a practices check that does not ANSWER in time REFUSES the call (kb/Work
PB3536): it used to pass it, so under a loaded host an unchecked spec went through, which is exactly what rule 2 is for
(test_dispatch_guard.py's "unchecked rendered spec" case went red inside a gate and green alone, 2026-10-22). A refusal
wedges nothing: the dispatch is re-issued.

The hook writes NOTHING (kb/Work PB3186). Its rule 3 once recorded every admitted write-capable dispatch in the
dispatch ledger from a scrape of every note id the prompt and the files it named mentioned, with the union of their
computed file sets: six entries of 303-910 files on 2026-10-15, naming reference notes as dispatched work, which bound
fix-lane worktrees to R3 notes and stopped their landings. The ledger is the planner's and the spec renderer's
(plan_wave.record_dispatch, through make_dispatch_specs.py), each group recorded with its exact file set; an attended
dispatch made without a rendered group is in flight from its worktree's first edit, and the landing check
(landing_check.py) is the guarantee behind the planner's partition.

There is no lander to guard (kb/Work PB3023): a branch lands through `scripts/orchestrator/enqueue.py land`, a script, and
its rule 4 (a lander dispatch named the loop's state) retired with the role; LandingPipelineDriftTests holds that no other
file opens or queues a pull request.
