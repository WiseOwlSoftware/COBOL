"""ruleset.py — THE RULESET ON `main` THAT MAKES GITHUB'S MERGE QUEUE THE LANDING, kept as data in the tree
(scripts/orchestrator/ruleset-main.json) and compared with the live repository (kb/Work PB3024; DESIGN-test-build-ci.md
§3.17.6).

    python scripts/orchestrator/ruleset.py check [--json]
    python scripts/orchestrator/ruleset.py apply --owner-go "<the owner's go, verbatim, with its time>" [--dry-run]
    python scripts/orchestrator/ruleset.py --self-test

WHY A FILE AND A CHECK. Classic branch protection has no merge queue, so `main` needs a RULESET: require a pull
request, require the merge queue (merge method MERGE: a merge commit, so the branch's commits stay ancestors of main),
require `ci-gate` (evaluated on the merge group), no bypass (enforced for administrators, as the classic protection's
enforce_admins was), no force push, no deletion; and three repository settings the queue needs (`allow_auto_merge`,
so a pull request whose checks are still running can be queued by auto-merge; `allow_merge_commit`;
`delete_branch_on_merge`).
A setting clicked into GitHub's UI is invisible to the tree and drifts unseen; this file IS the setting, and `check`
says whether the live repository still matches it.

`check` — one line, `ruleset: <STATE> — <detail>`, and the exit code (`--json` adds the state and the differences):
    0 ACTIVE   the committed ruleset is live on main, the merge queue exists, the repository settings match and the
               classic protection is gone. The ONLY state in which a landing may open or queue a pull request
               (scripts/orchestrator/enqueue.py refuses otherwise, exit 8 — the operator's review 2026-10-11: a PR
               opened before the queue exists runs only the cheap jobs, its `ci-gate` passes on them, and auto-merge
               would land it with no whole-population run). ACTIVE also prints the queue's depth.
    1 DRIFT    a ruleset of this name exists but differs (each difference named), or the classic protection is still
               on main beside it, or a repository setting differs.
    3 ABSENT   no ruleset of this name on main: the queue is not applied. Landing is BLOCKED until the owner re-applies
               it (`apply`): the queue is the only landing path, and main refuses a direct push.
    4 SKIPPED  the live state could not be read (no gh, not authenticated, no network, a timeout): NOT RUN, never a pass,
               and landing is BLOCKED until `check` reads ACTIVE.
    2          usage, or the committed file is unreadable.
Only the keys the committed file names are compared (GitHub adds ids, timestamps and defaults to the live ruleset);
keys starting with `$` are notes.

`apply` — run ONLY on the owner's explicit go (the attended session asks, one bare question: from that instant main
accepts only queued pull requests and nothing can push it directly). It sets the repository settings, creates
the ruleset or updates the one of the same name, deletes the classic protection (a 404 is "already gone"), then runs
`check` and exits with its code. `--owner-go` is required and printed with the result, so the transcript names the go.
`--dry-run` prints the calls and makes none.
