"""Self-test for ledger_state.py: owed until the current stamp is marked published, owed again after an input-touching
commit, and NOT owed after a commit that touches no input (the stamp rule is gen_ledger's, never a copy); and PER ACCOUNT
(kb/Work PB2481): each account has its own artifact URL and stamp, the first mark needs --url, a legacy record anchors
no account; and against MAIN (kb/Work PB2987): a landing pushed from another clone makes the next check owed while the
checkout the supervisor passes is still behind, mark-published refuses a page rendered from that stale checkout, and a
fast-forward lets it mark.
Run: python scripts/orchestrator/test_ledger_state.py   (a fabricated repo and its bare origin in a temp directory)."""
