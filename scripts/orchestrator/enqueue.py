"""enqueue.py — THE LANDING STEP, A SCRIPT: one finished branch, brought up to main, gated, its DEVLOG entry stamped,
checked, and handed to GitHub's merge queue as one pull request (kb/Work PB3023, PB3024; DESIGN-test-build-ci.md
sections 3.17.2 step 3, 3.17.5 and 3.17.6). No agent lands anything: the loop's landing lane (land_lane.py, kb/Work PB3103) runs
this per WAITING TO LAND branch, and an agent is dispatched only for what a script cannot decide (a conflict, a red gate, a queue bounce).

    python scripts/orchestrator/enqueue.py land <branch> [--worktree <path>] [--lane L] [--dry-run]  THE landing step
    python scripts/orchestrator/enqueue.py queue --title "<one-line subject>" --body-file <forensic message> [--dry-run]
    python scripts/orchestrator/enqueue.py checks [--rev HEAD] [--base origin/main]
    python scripts/orchestrator/enqueue.py --self-test

`land <branch>`, from any checkout (the branch's worktree is found by `git worktree list`, or named by --worktree):
  1. The worktree must be clean (STATUS.md and the harness's settings.local.json aside): a landing carries only commits.
     THE QUEUE GUARD, before anything is merged or gated: `ruleset.py check` must report the merge queue ACTIVE, or the
     exit is 8 with the branch unchanged. Main accepts only queued pull requests (the ruleset binds administrators too),
     so there is no other path to land by, and a gate spent while the queue is not ACTIVE could land nothing (kb/Work
     PB3023 review R1-1: the former direct-push landing arm merged and gated for half an hour with nothing holding main).
     THE REVIEW (MANDATORY-PRACTICES I10, L9; kb/Work PB3027): the branch's newest fix-lane report must carry
     `**Review:** CLEAN <reviewer> <head>` naming a commit of the branch, and every later commit must be main's, a clean
     merge of main (its tree the auto-merge of its parents) or DEVLOG-only; anything else (a finisher's fix, a
     hand-resolved conflict) is unreviewed: exit 11, the report gains `BLOCKED: enqueue — not reviewed …`, and the new
     tip goes to a reviewer. Only the lanes I10 does not review (UNREVIEWED_LANES: the registrar, the golden lane, the
     clerk) skip it, naming themselves with `--lane`.
  2. `git fetch` origin's main and, when the branch does not already contain it, MERGE it into the branch (never a
     rebase: a branch that merged a same-file predecessor or a sibling carries conflict resolutions in its merge
     commits, which a rebase throws away and asks for again; the queue lands by merge commit anyway, so the branch's
     history stays as written). THROUGH THE MERGE DRIVERS (scripts/merge_drivers.py, kb/Work PB3610): the keyed
     catalogues two landings both add to (wiseowl/diagnostics.json, the traceability inventory, constructs.json), the work
     notes they both append to and the runtime ABI pin are merged by key, not by line, and a merge that changed the pin
     measures the merged tree (abi_pin.py settle) before its merge commit, so none of those is a conflict. A conflict
     is aborted, the branch's report gains `BLOCKED: … conflict in <files>`, and the exit is 4: a finisher resolves it.
  3. THE GATE on the merged head, every host in GATES, each under the shared gate slot (the cap of 3, so concurrent
     enqueues queue there and never beyond it; build-local takes its own, every other row runs under `gate_slot.py
     run`, and no row runs while one would run outside it, kb/Work PB3104): each verdict line is read by the gate
     driver's one reader (`run_gate_legs.read_verdict`). BUSY — another gate holds the worktree's gate lock: it measured
     nothing and nothing is red — is exit 12 with NO report line (kb/Work PB3527: on 2026-10-22 it was read as a red and
     sent PB3511's branch to a finisher with nothing to fix); the landing lane lands it again once the lock is free.
     NOT RUN [<cause>] — the gate measured nothing — is read with its cause's class from the driver's ONE
     classification (run_gate_legs.NOT_RUN_CAUSES; kb/Work PB3526, review R2-1 of wave 1150), never re-derived here.
     An ENVIRONMENT cause (malformed shared gate settings, a host with no WSL, Python or SDK, a tree git cannot read) is
     exit 2 (usage or state) with NO report line: the lane retries it once, and a second at the head is the operator's
     handoff, never a finisher's. A BRANCH cause (a failure of code the gated tree carries: the gate driver, the
     population listing, no verdict line at all, a gate row refused for running outside the slot, the gate script's
     arguments) is measured against MAIN at the same step (`gate_main`: the same row in a clean checkout of the
     origin/main the branch merged, once per main head and host, recorded in MAIN_RUNS): main failing with the same
     cause is exit 2 with no report line (main's defect, the operator's); otherwise, main unmeasurable included, it
     blocks like a red, exit 5, the report gaining `BLOCKED: enqueue — the <host> gate was NOT RUN … by code the branch
     carries ([<cause>] …); main … reads …`, and goes to a finisher. Any other verdict that is not GREEN is exit 5, the
     report gains `BLOCKED: <host> gate … at enqueue — <verdict>`. A green head is recorded in
     the worktree's git directory (`enqueue-gated`); a later run whose head differs from it only by commits that are
     main's, clean merges or DEVLOG-only (`prune_worktrees.unreviewed_since`, the review's coverage rule) is not gated again.
  4. MAIN AGAIN, then the stamp, then `queue` (below). Main moves while a branch gates (the queue merges other pull
     requests), and `queue` takes only a head that descends from main; so origin/main is fetched again and, when it
     moved, MERGED in once more, without a second gate (kb/Work PB3023 review R1-2): the local gate confirms the change
     (step 3), and the merge group, which builds this pull request on the current main, runs the whole population
     (DESIGN-test-build-ci.md section 3.17.2 step 4). A conflict here is exit 4, as in step 2. Then `devlog.py stamp
     <branch>`: the branch's `DEVLOG/pending-<slug>.md` is numbered (alloc.py devlog: number order is stamp order) and
     stamped in one commit; an entry stamped by an earlier run keeps its number, even when main has since landed a
     higher one (kb/Work PB3123: the queue orders landings after their stamps). Then `queue`, the pull request titled with
     that entry's title and carrying the entry and the commit list as its body. Should main move again between the
     fetch and `queue`'s own (seconds), step 4 runs again, at most CATCH_UP times.
Every outcome ends on ONE line `=== ENQUEUE: <OUTCOME> … ===` for a caller to block on (MANDATORY-PRACTICES P2).

`queue`, run in the landing worktree on its committed, up-to-date HEAD:
  1. ⛔ THE QUEUE GUARD, FIRST: `ruleset.py check` must report the merge queue ACTIVE on main, or nothing is pushed or
     opened (exit 8). The operator's review (2026-10-11 13:39): a pull request runs only the cheap CI jobs, so its
     `ci-gate` passes on them; opened before the ruleset exists, `gh pr merge --auto` would merge it with NO
     whole-population run. LandingPipelineDriftTests holds that no other file in the tree opens or queues a pull
     request, so this guard is the only door.
  2. HEAD must be on a branch (not main, not detached) and a descendant of a freshly fetched origin/main (`land` merges
     it in; exit 2 otherwise).
  3. `checks` (below) on origin/main..HEAD.
  4. Push HEAD to the branch of the same name on origin (forced: the branch is this landing's own and moves on a
     rebase), reuse the branch's open pull request or open one (`gh pr create`), and queue it (`gh pr merge --auto`; the
     merge method is the queue's own, MERGE, so the branch's commits stay ancestors of main).
  5. Print `ENQUEUED pr=<n> sha=<sha> branch=<branch> url=<url>`, write the landing's measurement record (kb/Work
     PB3028, landing_measure.py: each carried change's DONE from git (landing_measure.done_times), enqueued now, the
     worktree's local gate seconds;
     a record that cannot be written is a loud warning, never a failed landing) and exit 0. It never waits for CI:
     the merge group runs the matrix, and a red there bounces only this PR (`landing_measure.py complete` reads the
     outcome from GitHub).

`checks` — THE LANDING CHECKS, one sequence in one place (`land` runs it before it opens the pull request), each
refusing on the landing's own range before a CI run is spent:
  devlog.py check   (exactly one new, stamped DEVLOG/ entry, numbered above the tree it was stamped on and unique;
                    kb/Work PB2605, PB3025, PB3123) → exit 6
  landing_check.py  (the R3 file-set partition and in-flight overlap; kb/Work PB2118) → exit 3 (STOP: re-plan, never
                    retry as is)
A check that cannot read its range is exit 2 (NOT RUN, never a pass). No landing check reads a record of one tree
(kb/Work PB3107): a merge group is built on every group queued ahead of it, so a committed record of the branch's own
tree (the arch-oracle baseline the retired landing oracle held it to, exit 7 until PB3107) cannot describe the tree that
lands, and two such landings queued together bounced each other; the oracle's baseline is now the capture of a
change's base commit, made on demand by scripts/arch/compare_oracle.py, and nothing is committed.

Exit: 0 queued or nothing to land · 2 usage or state (a dirty worktree, no branch, HEAD behind main, a check could not
run, a gate was NOT RUN for a cause in the environment or one main shares, main still moving after CATCH_UP merges) ·
3/6 a landing check refused (above) · 4 bringing main in conflicted · 5 a gate is not GREEN (a red, or a NOT RUN of
code the branch carries that main does not share) · 8 the merge queue is not ACTIVE (nothing merged, gated, pushed or opened) · 9 GitHub refused
the push, the pull request or the queue (main untouched; re-run after the cause is fixed — every step is idempotent) ·
11 the branch is not reviewed at its tip (`land` only; above) · 12 the gate is BUSY: another gate holds the worktree's
gate lock (`land` only; nothing ran, nothing is red; above).

AFTER `ENQUEUED`: the pull request is only HANDED to the queue (auto-merge on): GitHub queues it once its required
checks pass. Nothing here waits for that (no sleep loop in a landing): the landing lane's QUEUE WATCH (land_lane.py,
kb/Work PB3527) follows it into the merge queue on every tick and, when it stalls, applies `rerun_check` and then
`requeue` (below: this is the only file that queues a pull request) before it alerts the operator.
