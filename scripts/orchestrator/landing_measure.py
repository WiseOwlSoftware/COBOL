WHY. The owner authorized the landing-pipeline redesign on measurements (kb/Work PB3015; evidence
docs/rearchitecture/evidence/fleet-optimization/2026-10-11-pipeline-measurement-2026-10-10.md) and the redesign is
judged by the same instrument that found the problem: changes landed per hour and minutes per landing, before and
after (DESIGN-test-build-ci.md §3.17.5). This script replaced `train_measure.py`, whose record is a train (clusters,
first run, attribution minutes) — a unit that no longer exists once a finished branch is one pull request in GitHub's
merge queue (kb/Work PB3024). The retired file's records are the "before" column of `summary`.

THE RECORD, one JSON object per pull request in `<coord>/landing-measurements.jsonl` (outside every git worktree,
scripts/orchestrator/coord.py), built up by PATCHES: each `record` call sets only the fields it names, and the others
stay as an earlier call left them, because no single tool sees the whole life of a landing.
  done_each     when each change the pull request carries was finished: one time per change (per lead note), the
                committer time of the HEAD commit its DONE implementer report names — git's time, never a report
                file's, which the branch review rewrites when it stamps (`done_times`); `enqueue.py queue` fills it
  done          the earliest of `done_each` (the order check below runs on it); a later patch never moves it later
  review_clean  the finish review came back clean — whoever ran the review records it (`record --review-clean`)
  enqueued      the FIRST time the branch was queued (a bounce and a re-enqueue keep it: the wait includes the bounce)
  merged        GitHub's `mergedAt` — `complete` reads it
  bounces       merge-group runs of this pull request that FAILED (a run GitHub cancelled because an earlier entry
                failed is a ripple, not this pull request's bounce); `complete` counts them
  bounce_causes one of CAUSES per bounce, named by the finisher that fixed it; a bounce with no cause is counted
                UNATTRIBUTED, never guessed
  pre_queue_reds the pull request's OWN runs (event `pull_request`, its head branch) that FAILED before the queue took
                it (kb/Work PB3096): a red there never reaches a merge group, so `bounces` cannot see it; `complete`
                counts them, and a branch with no pull-request run at all stays null (UNMEASURED), never 0
  stalls        the pull request was handed to the queue but was NOT in it past the landing lane's grace (kb/Work
                PB3527): one entry per stalled read of the lane's queue watch, {read: its number, 1 first, cause: one
                of STALL_CAUSES, act: what the watch did (one of STALL_ACTS), ok: whether GitHub took it, at}. A stall
                is not a bounce: `bounces` counts failed merge-group runs, which `complete` re-reads from GitHub, and a
                stalled pull request never reached a merge group (the lane writes them, `record_stall`)
  ci_wall_s     the successful merge-group run's wall time (`complete`)
  local_gate_s  the seconds of every local gate the landing worktree ran (the sum of its verdict.json `timings.wall_s`)
  landing_gate_runs  how many of those gates the LANDING ran itself (`enqueue.py land`): 0 under the rule of 2026-10-23
                (a branch is gated once, at its head, by its implementer; the merge with main is the merge queue's to
                test, kb/Work PB3612), 1 when bringing main in changed a file the branch also changes or the lane gates
                nowhere else; null for a landing recorded before that rule or by hand, and `summary` says so
A field never observed stays null and `summary` says how many landings lack it: a MISSING observation is not a zero.

`summary` prints the after column (this file) beside the before column (the retired train records, then the frozen
2026-10-10 evidence): changes landed per hour, median and p90 minutes DONE → on main per change, bounces per landing
and their causes, pull-request reds before the queue per landing, merge-group CI wall, local gate minutes. `freeze` copies the retired train file under
docs/rearchitecture/evidence/fleet-optimization/ together with the first after-summary (it refuses until a pull request
has landed), after which `summary` reads the tracked copy and the coordination directory's file is no longer needed.

    known). The time is git's, never a file's: the committer time of the HEAD commit a DONE implementer report names
    (the implementer's last commit, minutes before its report). A report file's time is NOT used, because the branch
    review rewrites the report it stamps (review_findings.py stamp, kb/Work PB3027) and a finisher's re-review re-stamps
    its own, so a file time is the LAST rewrite, never the finish (review finding R1-1 of PB3028's branch).

    The changes are found from two seeds, each a DONE report (plan_wave.parse_report: its status, lead note and HEAD):
      - a report whose header names `branch` (the implementer's own branch, queued as it is);
      - a report a commit in `upstream..HEAD` names on its `Report:` line: each cluster commit of a lander's train
        carries one (the retired train applier wrote it), and no implementer report names that train's branch
        (review finding R1-2).
    A change is one LEAD note: its time is the earliest of every DONE report with that lead whose HEAD is an ancestor
    of the seed's HEAD — so a review finisher's branch, which merged its predecessor's (kb/Work PB3027, I10), keeps the
    first implementer's finish, and the review and finisher wait is inside DONE → on main. (A branch REBASED onto main
    rewrites its predecessor's commits; the chain then ends at the finisher's own report.) A report whose HEAD commit
    is after `not_after` (the queue) is no DONE of this landing, and a lander's report (status LANDED) is no seed.
    A report whose HEAD is already on `upstream` is a change that LANDED before this one: it is neither a seed nor in
    a chain (review finding R1-1 of PB3028's finisher). The merge queue merges with method MERGE (ruleset-main.json),
    so every landed branch head is an ancestor of main and of every branch cut after it; without this a later landing
    under a reused lead note (PB2426 had seven separate records landings; PB3024 lands in phases) would take the FIRST
    landing's finish as its DONE. plan_wave's branch survey applies the same rule: an ancestor of origin/main landed."""
