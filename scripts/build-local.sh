# build-local.sh — THE GATE, as one command (kb/Work PB1708, PB1721, PB3022; docs/rearchitecture/DESIGN-test-build-ci.md
# §3.14.1–3.14.6, §3.17.3; the bash twin of build-local.ps1). It hands the gate to its driver, scripts/run_gate_legs.py,
# which holds this worktree's gate lock, runs the audits (before any slot, kb/Work PB2524), takes a gate slot, runs the
# solution build, lists the population, plans the order and runs leg 1 of it — the change's own tests, the previous
# gate's reds, the host-only witnesses (tier 0h), the cheap tree-wide sweeps (tier 0c), the drift tests that govern
# a changed file (tier 0d) and the cheapest cases the change reaches — then checks that population and prints
# `=== BUILD-LOCAL GATE: … ===`.
# ⛔ THE GATE OUTLIVES THIS COMMAND (kb/Work PB3536; DESIGN-test-build-ci.md §3.14.12): the driver starts the gate
# DETACHED in its run directory (`TestResults/build-local/<run>/`: gate.log, gate.pid, verdict.json) and follows it, so
# a caller killed mid-gate leaves it running to its verdict, which `python scripts/run_gate_legs.py --await <run>`
# reads; and a re-gate of an unchanged tree answers from the recorded GREEN (`… GREEN — REUSED: …`), running nothing.
# ⛔ ONE GATE, ONE SHAPE (owner 2026-10-11, kb/Work PB3015/PB3022): there is no mode; the verdict line says
# `LEG 1 ONLY (batched gating, PB2515)`, and CI's merge-group run is the whole-population regression net. Only while
# the owner sets the shared scope to `whole` (`gate_slot.py set-implementer-scope whole`) does it run leg 2 too.
# ⛔ ORDER, DON'T SKIP (owner, 2026-09-28): no gate filters.
# Usage:  bash scripts/build-local.sh
