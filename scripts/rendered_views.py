"""rendered_views.py — THE REGISTRY OF RENDERED VIEWS: every generated index the tree does NOT hold (kb/Work PB3026).

    python scripts/rendered_views.py                    # render every light view to its path (gitignored, or outside the tree)
    python scripts/rendered_views.py drift-rules        # render the named view(s) only (the only way to render a heavy one)
    python scripts/rendered_views.py --check            # CI's `audits` job and the gate's audits: every view renders,
                                                        #   none is tracked, every in-tree one is gitignored
    python scripts/rendered_views.py --list             # name · output · generator
    python scripts/rendered_views.py --self-test

⛔ THE RULE (DESIGN-test-build-ci.md §3.17.4; owner decisions 2026-10-11 via kb/Work PB3015): THE TREE HOLDS SOURCES,
VIEWS ARE RENDERED. A committed file that every landing touching its inputs REGENERATES is a guaranteed collision once
landings are queued pull requests: two PRs that each add a drift test both rewrite `docs/DRIFT_RULES.md`'s count line,
and the second is bounced. A generated file nobody regenerates is the opposite failure: the probe printed
"kb/Conformance burn-down is STALE" for days. A view that is rendered on demand can be neither — there is nothing to
commit and nothing to go stale — so each is gitignored and its generator renders it when asked.

What is a VIEW here, and what is not: a view is DERIVED from tracked sources by a script that needs nothing outside the
tree (or the coordination directory), so it can be rendered on demand — the drift-rule index, the conformance
burn-down, the diagnostics table, the ledger page. These stay TRACKED, on purpose, and are not views: a SOURCE file
the build compiles (`*.g.cs`, `*.Table.cs`: a clone must build with `dotnet build` and no pre-step; each is pinned by
its own drift test), DATA extracted from the licensed standard (`spec-rule-catalog.json`, the reserved-word tables:
the generator needs the private PDF, which CI does not have), and a view DEFINITION (`kb/Work.base` is an Obsidian
query over the notes, not generated content).

ONE REGISTRY, ONE RULE (rule 4: no hand list per consumer). `VIEWS` below is the only place a view is named. The
gate's audits and CI's `audits` job call `--check`, which enforces, per view (no test calls it: rule (c) reads the head
of every tracked `kb/` note, and a test that did would make the vault a test input, kb/Work PB2878):
  (a) NOT TRACKED — `git ls-files` finds nothing at its output (the rule DESIGN-test-build-ci.md §3.17.4 names: tracked ∩ outputs = ∅);
  (b) GITIGNORED when its output is inside the tree — otherwise a render leaves the checkout dirty, and a dirty main
      checkout sends the orchestrator loop to `resume`;
  (c) NOTHING UNREGISTERED — no tracked `docs/**.md` or `kb/**.md` declares itself generated in its first lines (the sweep
      for the next case: a new generated index added by copying the old habit is refused until it has a row);
  (d) RENDERS — the generator's own `--check` renders it in memory and exits non-zero when its sources no longer
      produce a view (a drift test deleted its `<summary>`, an inventory row lost a field, the plan cannot be read).
A view rendered by a C# test (it reads the compiled catalogue) names that test instead, and the test is its (d).

ABSENT IS NEVER STALE: a view is not compared with a copy on disk, because nothing is promised about a copy. The
session probe renders the burn-down itself, so the copy a session reads is the one it just made.
