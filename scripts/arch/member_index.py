"""member_index.py — the member index: a restructuring note's file set COMPUTED from the code, never hand-listed
(kb/Work PB2118 Draft 8, J2; docs/rearchitecture/DESIGN-architecture-review.md §8.7 "the file-set partition").

WHY. A wave that moves or changes a symbol edits every file that uses it in the same change (CLAUDE.md rule 4: no
alias, shim or forwarder), so those files are in its file set, and the file-set partition (the ONLY gate between a
restructuring wave and the fix lane's trains; owner, PB2118 question 5) protects only what the set holds. Draft 7's
PB2296 hand-listed 15 files and missed 16 callers (the seventh refuter, J2); `scripts/spec/where.py` maps spec clauses
to files, not C# members to callers. This is the mechanism.

WHAT. The census's Roslyn host (`tools/ArchCensus --member-index`) runs the census's one semantic walk over every
product and test project and writes, per symbol NAME (`Ns.Type.Member`, overloads merged), the authored files that
use it — a type's entry also holds every file that uses any of its members — and, per type and per authored member
(used or not), the files declaring it, and, for every type and member of the EMITTED SURFACE (the runtime generated
programs call), the authored files that write its name as C# TEXT (`emitted`: the code generator's `catch
(ProgramReturn)` binds no symbol; PB2118 Draft 9, the eighth refuter's K1).
This script records that at one commit as frozen evidence (`docs/rearchitecture/evidence/arch-census/<sha>.members.json.gz`,
with every walked file's git blob id), and answers queries against the CURRENT tree:

  * a note's SITES and NAMES, read by ONE reader, `scripts/spec/work.py` `note_sites` (kb/Work PB3242): the paths of
    its site blocks (Code site / Site / Sites), and every name on its `**Moves or changes:**` line, its `r2_members:`
    line and every documentation id in a site block (`M:Ns.T.Member(...)`, the Delete notes' sites); never a path in
    its prose. PLUS every word of its target paragraph that is a member of a type the note names or its sites declare
    (`Options` in PB2296's target is `DataBinder.Options`: a hand-listed line missed it, the eighth refuter's K1); a
    RESTRUCTURING note (a `**Wave kind:**`) naming none falls back to every type DECLARED in the files and folders its
    sites name (a Move/rename note's folder, an Extract note's class files) — the conservative set; a fix-lane note
    naming none declares its sites only (its fix goes there; it renames nothing);
  * their CALLERS: the index's files for each name (a type with its nested types and declaring files; a member with
    its type's declaring files; the emitters writing either as text), plus, for a restructuring note, every tracked
    code file under a FOLDER a site names, on the current tree (a fix-lane note's folder site reserves nothing: never
    a whole subsystem, kb/Work PB3670), plus DRIFT: every tracked `.cs` under src/ or tests/ whose blob differs from the
    index's (or that is new since) is scanned for each KNOWN name's last segment as a whole word and included on a
    hit; files deleted since drop out. Drift widens the callers of a name the index KNOWS (an unknown name has none);
    it cannot see a type a landing ADDED (the index never named it), which is why the planner never plans on a stale
    index;
  * a name the index does not know is UNKNOWN and reported (a typo or a renamed member is a failure, not a smaller set).

CURRENCY (the eighth refuter's K1 (3): PB833 added `IO/Sharing/OfdRegionLocks.cs` inside PB2251's site folder after
the index was recorded, and the frozen index never saw it). Every index carries `treeKey`, the hash of the inputs it
was walked from (`tree_key`: the tracked C#, project and solution files under src/ and tests/, and the host's own
sources). `current()` returns the index whose key is the checkout's: a committed record, or one regenerated into a
cache directory (the coordination directory's `member-index/`), or, with regeneration off, a REFUSAL. The planner
(`plan_wave.py --cluster`) plans only on a current index. The planner's set is still the ADMISSION estimate; the
GUARANTEE is the landing check (`scripts/orchestrator/landing_check.py`, run by `enqueue.py land`), which compares each
landing's ACTUAL diff with its declared set and with every in-flight branch (DESIGN-architecture-review §8.7).

  * its MEMBERS: the members its site blocks name in a file (`path#Member`, `path (`member`, …)`, work.NoteSites.members)
    for a site file that is no caller; the planner's partition meets on those, and on every other file whole
    (plan_wave.collision, scripts/arch/source_units.py; kb/Work PB3670).

Callers: `plan_wave.declared_sets` (the planner's collision check, `file_set_collisions`, the spec renderer's and the
landing check's computed set, all on THE index of the tree: kb/Work PB3203) returns `note_file_set`'s `files` and
`members`, and
`work.py check` fails an open PB2119 note whose names are unknown (on `load()`: the newest committed record, a check
bounded by time).

Usage:
    python scripts/arch/member_index.py --record            # build Cobol.Net.sln, run the host, write the record for HEAD
    python scripts/arch/member_index.py --current --cache <dir>   # the index of this tree: found, or regenerated
    python scripts/arch/member_index.py --note PB2296       # print a note's names, unknowns and computed file set
