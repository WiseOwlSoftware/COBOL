"""compare_oracle.py — the behavior-neutrality comparison every restructuring wave runs (kb/Work PB2116;
docs/rearchitecture/DESIGN-architecture-review.md §4).

Compares two oracle captures CASE BY CASE, never by totals: every case whose emitted C# or diagnostic stream
differs is printed with its id (which names the program, or construct, and the edition), and so is every case one
capture has and the other lacks. Exit 0 only when the two are identical; a wave's DEVLOG entry either shows the
IDENTICAL line or explains every difference (a renamed runtime helper is the only expected class).

THE BASELINE IS THE CHANGE'S OWN BASE COMMIT, CAPTURED (kb/Work PB3107). A capture is a pure function of its commit
(DESIGN-architecture-review.md §4.1: two captures of one commit are identical), so nothing is committed: the baseline
is the capture of the commit the change departs from, by default the merge base of HEAD and origin/main, made on
demand by that commit's OWN capture_oracle.py in a detached worktree of it and kept under
TestResults/arch-oracle/<commit12>/ (blobs and manifest), where a later comparison against the same base finds it.
A committed baseline could describe only the tree it was recorded on, and GitHub's merge queue lands each pull
request on a tree no branch ever recorded (its group is built on every group queued ahead of it): two input-changing
landings queued together left two baselines, or one behind the other's inputs, and bounced (PB3107).

USAGE
  python scripts/arch/compare_oracle.py [--base REV] [--diff] [--no-build] [--jobs N]
  python scripts/arch/compare_oracle.py <baseline-manifest> [<new-manifest>] [--diff] [--no-build] [--jobs N]

  --base REV           the commit to compare against (default: `git merge-base HEAD origin/main`), captured as above
  <baseline-manifest>  instead, an existing capture's TestResults/arch-oracle/<label>/manifest.json
  <new-manifest>       default: capture the current tree now (scripts/arch/capture_oracle.py, into TestResults/)
  --diff               print a unified diff of each differing case from the two captures' blob directories (the
                       directory each manifest sits in)

OUTPUT
  CSHARP <id>       the emitted C# differs
  DIAGNOSTICS <id>  the diagnostic stream differs
  ADDED <id>        only the new capture has the case (a golden the change adds)
  REMOVED <id>      only the baseline has it
  === ARCH-ORACLE: IDENTICAL — N cases ...   or   === ARCH-ORACLE: DIFFERENT — k of N cases ...
Exit status: 0 identical, 1 different, 2 usage error or a capture that could not be made (never "different").
