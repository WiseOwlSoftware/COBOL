# WiseOwl COBOL — Claude Code Instructions

## ⛔ Non-negotiable process rules
Owner-emphasized, each earned by a correction. These nine are the SSOT; `PROMPT.md` holds the standing doctrine
(mission, architectural commitments, the four required reviews) and does not restate them.

1. **The ISO/IEC 1989:2023 spec (`specs/ISO_COBOL.md`) defines correct behavior for EVERY case.** Read it and cite
   the exact §/GR for any semantics, syntax, or output question. The NIST goldens and the
   GnuCOBOL differential are regression NETS with known holes — never authority. **Where there are several
   implementation options, the precedence is: the ISO spec if it controls → otherwise GnuCOBOL → if GnuCOBOL has
   nothing, IBM Enterprise COBOL or Micro Focus** (owner, 2026-08-08 via `kb/Work/R13`, restated 2026-09-22). This
   settles implementor LATITUDE only — never GnuCOBOL's non-ISO extensions — and the choice is documented in
   `docs/CONFORMANCE.md`. When a general-format DIAGRAM is
   load-bearing, render the PDF page (`scripts/render-spec-page.py <page>`): the OCR'd diagrams were systematically
   lossy toward falsely-restrictive syntax.
   **⛔ VALIDATE EVERY CITATION MECHANICALLY — `python scripts/spec/cite.py --check <clause> "<text>"`.** The
   failure mode is not inventing a citation, it is INHERITING one: a queue entry or design doc carries a §, its
   quoted text is genuinely in the standard, and the clause NUMBER is never re-derived before it propagates into
   code comments, goldens and the DEVLOG. Two CA10 citations were wrong exactly this way. A citation you did not
   run `--check` on is not a citation.
2. **Implement each feature FROM its subsystem deep-dive design doc** (`docs/DESIGN.md` §0.5 lists them)
   plus the spec. Follow the doc; do not improvise. A design correction updates the doc in the same change set.
3. **Implement the COMPLETE feature to spec + design — never scope to what a test references.** Tests verify, they
   do not scope. Deferral, a GAP, or rejecting legal source is debt, and only an explicit owner decision.
4. **Fix the root architectural cause.** No workarounds, no papering over, no relabeling a bug a "quirk", never
   change valid COBOL to dodge a compiler bug. Every bug is a pattern — sweep for its siblings.
   **⛔ NO WRAPPERS, SHIMS, FORWARDERS, ALIASES OR COMPATIBILITY LAYERS, anywhere: compilers, runtime, tests,
   scripts, tooling, skills.** There is NO backward-compatibility requirement. When something moves, is renamed or
   is replaced, change EVERY caller and delete the old one in the same change (owner, repeated 2026-09-28).
5. **RE-DESIGN AND RE-ARCHITECT WHEN NECESSARY — a stated scope is an estimate, never a ceiling.** This compiler
   is production quality and must stay supportable for MORE THAN A DECADE, so when a queue entry, finding or
   design doc says "one clause, no structural change" and implementation proves otherwise, the answer is the
   restructuring — never the smallest diff that fits the estimate, and never a hand-maintained list where a
   structure belongs. **Prefer the shape that makes the NEXT case automatic over the one that makes this case
   small**, and pair it with a drift test so "automatic" stays true. Correcting the estimate is part of the work:
   update the design doc and say so. (Rule 3 forbids shrinking the FEATURE; this forbids shrinking the DESIGN.)
6. **Keep the docs CURRENT in the same change set.** Every doc except the DEVLOG describes the CURRENT compiler.
   The historical narrative lives ONLY in `DEVLOG/`, one file per entry, read newest first (`python scripts/devlog.py
   render`; kb/Work PB3025). Write the entry as `DEVLOG/pending-<slug>.md` (first line `## <Title>`); the landing
   numbers and stamps it with `python scripts/devlog.py stamp <branch>`, as `## Entry NNNN — YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ —
   Title`. **One entry per landing on main** (owner 2026-10-08, kb/Work PB2605: the rule covers "Only commits landing
   on main"; a worktree's checkpoint commits carry no stamped one): the landing checks (`enqueue.py checks`, at every
   landing) run `devlog.py check`, which refuses a landing without it.
7. **Work autonomously.** Commit AND push every checkpoint, with a forensic commit message; each landing on main
   carries its DEVLOG entry (rule 6).
   Grammar changes are pre-authorized. Prompt only for genuine owner decisions — one at a time, as a bare question.

8. **⛔ THERE IS EXACTLY ONE WORK REGISTER — `kb/Work/` — AND YOU MAY NOT CREATE ANOTHER.** One note per item
   (`kind:` defect · analysis · adjudication · decision · upstream), tracked in git, frontmatter carrying `status`,
   `severity`, `area`, the harm flags, `inventory_rows` (the traceability-inventory rows the note CLAIMS while
   it is open) and `closes_rows` (the rows its landing CLOSED, with a `closes_rows_reason:` when it closed none);
   the forensic prose lives in the note body. Its views are `work.py` subcommands (`blocked`, `unharmed`, `analyses`,
   `landed`, `upstream`, `stats`), not a file for an application (kb/Work PB3799).
   **Read it with `python scripts/spec/work.py next` and keep it CURRENT in the same change set as the work** —
   a landed fix flips its note's `status` AND writes `closes_rows` in the commit that lands it, and a newly
   found defect becomes a note before it becomes a DEVLOG paragraph.
   ⛔ **DO NOT open a new list, table, tracker, checklist or "remaining work" section anywhere — not in plan §0,
   not in a design doc, not in a new markdown file, not in a JSON sidecar.** Five such registers accumulated by
   2026-08-04, three of which each declared themselves canonical, and the cost was measurable: a WRONG-ANSWER
   defect (`EXCEPTION-STATEMENT` returns `GO` where Table 12 requires `GO TO`) sat inside a prose paragraph where
   no work list could see it, while §0's own duplicate table rotted into listing landed items as open. **If you
   feel the urge to start a list, add notes to `kb/Work/` instead.** The only other registers are the ones
   derived mechanically from the spec (the rule catalog → the traceability inventory → its generated burn-down)
   and `constructs.json`; those are GENERATED or CI-owned, never hand-maintained work lists.

9. **⛔ NO DISPATCH WITHOUT THE `workstream` SKILL, AND AN AGENT FIXES WHAT IT FINDS.** Before ANY implementer, finisher
   or fleet dispatch, invoke the `workstream` skill and follow `.claude/skills/workstream/templates/MANDATORY-PRACTICES.md`:
   render specs with `make_dispatch_specs.py`, get `check_practices.py` GREEN, read the quota meter first, dispatch
   through the Workflow rolling wave. `scripts/hooks/dispatch_guard.py` REFUSES the call otherwise (owner 2026-09-30,
   after a session hand-wrote three briefs and skipped the skill: "all future sessions cannot skip learning this").
   Token frugality is met by the skill's levers, never by skipping it. And an agent that has already read a file
   and finds NEW issues in it FIXES them in the same change, with golden and sibling sweep, unless the effort is so
   excessive (a redesign beyond its slice, or its turn budget) that the issue must become a `kb/Work/` note instead
   (MANDATORY-PRACTICES I9, owner 2026-09-30).

## Start here every session
0. **Load the skills the SessionStart hook's `SKILLS` block names** — `session-start` first, then your lane's
   (`workstream` for the operator before it supervises, lands or dispatches) — at every start, resume and clear, in an
   attended session and in a loop unit alike; after a compaction the loaded skills stay in force (owner 2026-10-08).
1. **`kb/Work/` — THE WORK REGISTER, and the answer to "what do I do now".** Run
   `python scripts/spec/work.py next` (**Fix next**; `work.py blocked`, `unharmed`, `analyses`, `landed` and `upstream`
   are the other views, each with `--json`). It ranks on what a defect DOES to a user's program, not on its severity label. ⛔ Never re-derive a worklist from prose.
2. **`docs/REARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` §0** — live state, gates, open GAPs, owner decisions and the campaign
   narrative. ⛔ **It no longer carries a worklist and must never regrow one** (rule 8). Trust §0 over any status
   written anywhere else, including memory — but trust `kb/Work/` over §0 for what is OPEN.
3. **`pwsh scripts/session-probe.ps1`** — the mechanical state check (branch · dirty/unpushed · next-free
   diagnostic code · VCR todos · corpus counts · inventory GAP). Never hand-read state a script can compute.
4. Before the session ends: update the `kb/Work/` notes you touched, update §0, add a DEVLOG entry.

## The project
WiseOwl COBOL (repo `WiseOwlSoftware/COBOL`; code `src/WiseOwl.Cobol.*` in namespaces `WiseOwl.Cobol.*`, solution
`WiseOwl.Cobol.sln`, exe `cobol`, NuGet `WiseOwl.COBOL`) compiles COBOL into **idiomatic typed-native C# built by Roslyn**: a
COBOL record IS a .NET `record struct`, an elementary item IS a native field. **There is NO byte `ProgramState`
substrate — never reintroduce one.** The legacy byte engine that had one is deleted from `main` (PHASE 15 Cut 2,
kb/Work PB2110); `docs/rearchitecture/LEGACY-ARCHIVE.md` names the tag that preserves it.

**Mission (owner decision D13):** a commercial-quality, decades-sustainable compiler that is **100% conforming to
ISO/IEC 1989:2023 per §4.2.1, with correct support for 1985/2002/2014** — validated as four per-edition compilers
by the VERSION TEST MATRIX (`docs/VERSION_TEST_MATRIX_DESIGN.md` + `docs/VERSION_CHANGE_REFERENCE.md`; the default
`--std` is COBOL-2023). Done = the PHASE-14 Step-0 traceability inventory at zero GAP.

**The product bar is broader than conformance.** The owner requires four review dimensions — **architecture · full
code review · performance · duplication and efficiency** — as continuous criteria on every change, and as a
comprehensive pass once the design settles (`PROMPT.md` §4).

## Where things live
- **Plan / live state:** `docs/REARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` — §0 live state · §3 execution model · §8
  forward-residue ledger · §9 verification commands + corpus mechanics · §11 analysis backlog · §12 risk register.
- **Design SSOT:** `docs/DESIGN.md` plus the `docs/rearchitecture/DESIGN-*.md` deep-dives.
- **Names:** the code carries the product's name, `WiseOwl.Cobol` (owner, kb/Work PB3837); the product's earlier names
  live only in history, and `scripts/rename_retired_names.py --check` (the RETIRED NAMES audit) refuses them elsewhere.
  Implementor environment variables are `WISEOWL_COBOL_*`.
- **The work register:** **`kb/Work/`** — ONE note per item (defect · analysis · adjudication · decision · upstream),
  tracked in git, with the forensic prose in the note body. `python scripts/spec/work.py next` prints **`Fix next`**,
  which ranks on what a defect DOES to a user's program, not on its severity label (the other views are the
  `work.py` subcommands `blocked`, `unharmed`, `analyses`, `landed`, `upstream`); session-probe shows it every session. ⛔ It replaced FIVE overlapping registers, three of
  which each claimed to be canonical; `CONFORMANCE-FIX-QUEUE.md` is now a pointer.
- **History:** `DEVLOG/` (one file per entry), and nowhere else. **Doctrine:** `PROMPT.md`.
- **Doc map:** `docs/DOC_INDEX.md` — consult it to find the right doc and keep it in sync. Exactly one canonical
  doc per subsystem: extend it, never fork a second.
- **Spec:** `specs/ISO_COBOL.md` (tracked in this repo). The licensed PDF is the private submodule `specs-private`
  (`git submodule update --init --recursive`) — needed only to render a page (`scripts/render-spec-page.py`).

## Testing
The owner decided on 2026-09-28 (kb/Work PB1708): ORDER, DON'T SKIP. Every gate plans the whole discovered
population of Conformance, Unit and Characterization, ordered, and no gate filters. **The gate has ONE shape (owner
2026-10-11, kb/Work PB3015 Q1a, PB3022): `pwsh scripts/build-local.ps1 -Priority BelowNormal`** (MANDATORY-PRACTICES
I1/I2; kb/Work PB1721) for an implementer's commit and a re-gate after a fix alike:
the likely failures first, fail-fast, inside a gate slot that caps how many gates run at once (one shared cap, 3 by
default, kb/Work PB2514). **Batched gating (owner 2026-10-10, kb/Work PB2515):** the gate runs leg 1 only — the
change's own tests, the previous reds, the host-only witnesses (`[Trait("Host", "ReFS")]`, tier 0h), the cheap
tree-wide sweeps (`[Trait("Sweep", "tree")]`, tier 0c) and the cheapest reach, or the WHOLE tier 1 when the change
cannot be attributed precisely (owner 2026-10-31, kb/Work PB4269) — and its verdict reads `LEG 1 ONLY
(batched gating, PB2515): GREEN|RED`; CI is the regression net and the ONLY whole-population run (owner 2026-10-11
~11:20: "local testing confirms the targeted change; CI/CD ensures no regression on the remaining codebase"). A
self-test whose inputs are unchanged since a recorded PASS is reused, never re-run, by every gate (kb/Work PB2914,
PB3022). **A branch lands through ONE script, `python scripts/orchestrator/enqueue.py land <branch>`** (kb/Work
PB3023): it reads the record of the branch's local gate (it refuses a tip none covers, exit 14), merges origin/main in,
stamps the DEVLOG entry, runs the landing checks and queues one pull request in GitHub's merge queue (it refuses while
the queue is not ACTIVE); there is no lander and no train. **A branch is gated locally ONCE, at its head (owner
2026-10-23, kb/Work PB3612): leg 1 on Windows and the same plan's legs in a WSL clone of the committed head, under the
one slot, inside that one gate. The merge with main is gated by the merge queue's CI, never re-gated locally** — except
when bringing main in changed a file the branch also changes (a true textual merge in a shared file), where the one gate
runs once on the merged head. Under batched gating leg 1 is the local run, so the impact map's tiers decide which cases
it holds: the loop records a map for every main commit it adopts (owner 2026-10-24, kb/Work PB3663), a map serves a
base file by file, and a base with no map costs the aim, never the population (CI's merge-group run). Run the comprehensive
battery plus the GnuCOBOL differential once per accumulated batch, pre-merge, in its own worktree. **CI also runs on
Linux, so the implementer's gate runs the Linux half of the targeted leg under WSL before a push** (`scripts/linux-gate.sh
--legs targeted`, kb/Work PB1732, PB3612); without `--legs targeted` that script runs CI's four whole Linux legs (unit,
characterization, conformance, and CI's `guard` job), about 6 minutes, the tool that reproduces a Linux CI red on this
box. Build `WiseOwl.Cobol.sln` (not a single project) before
any `--no-build` run. Commands and the current battery baseline are in plan §0 "Gates" and §9.
⛔ **THE CI INVARIANT (owner 2026-10-04): GitHub CI must never fail when the same code was tested locally by the same
processes.** CI is the verification of the local process, never its first run. A CI red is therefore ALSO a defect in the
local gates: find why they did not see it and fix that in the same change (a missing leg, an unpinned tool, a setting CI has
and the local run lacks), then sweep for the others like it (rule 4). `kb/Work/PB1957` is the survey of the known
differences and carries the drift test that maps every CI job to a local leg or to a recorded reason it cannot run locally.
**CI and every local host run the SAME tool versions, and those are the LATEST releases** (owner 2026-10-28: "CI and
local should always be using the latest version"; kb/Work PB4007): one toolchain manifest names each version, everything
installs from it, and a version is never left to a runner image or to whatever a host happens to have.
