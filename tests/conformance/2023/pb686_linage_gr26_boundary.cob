      *> page size is arm a): page overflow, the record pushed to the

      *>
      *> WHY THAT LITERAL READING IS REJECTED. It contradicts three
      *> other rules, each of which this fixture also exercises.
      *>   python scripts/spec/cite.py --check 13.18.34.4 "specifies

      *>      GR1 leaves no independent condition and GR2 says the

      *> does on FTG — §14.9.51.4 GR25 makes an omitted ADVANCING
      *> phrase act as AFTER ADVANCING 1 LINE, and the connector
      *> reaches that through its print path — but the end-of-page
      *> condition is a function of the COUNTER, so the displayed
