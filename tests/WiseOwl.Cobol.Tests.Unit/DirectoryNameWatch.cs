/// answers "access denied" to every open inside it and every listing of it), whereas one renamed away first
/// (<c>SidecarLockFiles.RetireDirectory</c>) takes its name out of every prober's reach in one step. That race happens a
/// few times in a thousand and cannot be made to happen on demand, but the operating environment REPORTS the order, so
