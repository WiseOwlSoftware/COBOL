/// ⛔ EVERY PLACE THE FRONT END READS THE COMPILE EDITION IS ONE THE PB2291 VERDICT RECORDED (kb/Work PB2291;
/// docs/rearchitecture/DESIGN-architecture-review.md §8.4; DESIGN.md §1.1, the D7 rule).
///
/// <para><b>The rule D7 states.</b> The grammar parses the SUPERSET of all editions and the ONE edition gate is the
/// post-bind <c>VersionConformancePass</c>. The front end nevertheless reads the edition in two ways that no post-bind
/// gate can replace — and, until PB2291, in one way it should not. A read either decides <b>word status</b> (ISO §8.9:
/// whether a word is RESERVED at this edition, so a legal earlier-edition program that uses LOCATION, RETRY or LOCALE as
/// a name keeps its reading; and the Annex C spelling a word has there) or it is a <b>construct gate</b> (a construct
/// whose words have no other reading below its introducing edition, refused at parse time instead of being named by
/// the conformance pass). Word-status reads are sanctioned, and so is the one §14.5.3.3 phrase-association read
/// (which statement a [NOT] phrase belongs to depends on the formats the edition prints, kb/Work PB3830); a construct
/// gate is a D7 defect.</para>
///
/// <para><b>What this test computes, rather than lists</b> (§8.4's rule, applied):
/// <list type="number">
///   <item>EDITION STATE is the parser's <c>Edition</c> property, an <c>EditionInfo</c>, or a lexer field PRIMED from
///     one — the fields the retype stage's edition reads set through a lexer setter (computed from
///     <c>TokenRetypes</c>, never named here).</item>
///   <item>An EDITION READ is a method or property of the parser (<c>CobolParserCoreBase</c>, every committed
///     <c>CobolParserCore</c> partial and any parser grammar's <c>@members</c>), of the lexer (<c>CobolLexer.g4</c>'s
///     <c>@members</c> and its committed partials) or of the retype stage (<c>TokenRetypes</c>) — a NESTED type's
///     members included, since C# lets a nested type read its container's protected and private state through an
///     instance — whose syntax reaches edition state, or that calls another read — to a fixpoint. A type in
///     <c>src/</c> DERIVED from a stage (transitively, computed from every base list) reads the stage's protected
///     state and calls its protected reads through <c>this</c>, so its members that reach edition state or a stage
///     read are reads too, recorded under the derived type's own file as <c>Type.Member</c>.</item>
///   <item>A SITE is a predicate or action body of any grammar that names a read OR edition state itself
///     (<c>{Edition.Has(2014)}?</c>, a primed lexer field); any C# member in <c>src/</c> outside a read's own stage
///     (the parser's syntax-error listeners, the front end's driver) that calls or reads that read; a
///     front-end member that hands the edition to a parser (<c>Edition = …</c>); and any caller of such a member that
///     is not private (it passes the edition on).</item>
/// </list>
/// Outside the parser, edition state cannot be read at all: the parser's <c>Edition</c> getter is <c>protected</c>
/// (the compiler refuses <c>parser.Edition</c> in a listener or pass) and the lexer's primed fields are private, and
/// <see cref="TheParsersEdition_IsWriteOnlyOutsideIt"/> pins that, so the C# arm needs no type inference. The only
/// code that CAN still read that state is lexically inside the stage — its nested types too — or in a type derived
/// from it (the generated <c>CobolParserCore</c> is a non-sealed public partial and <c>CobolParserCoreBase</c> is
/// public abstract), which is exactly the code the read arm takes as the stage's members
/// (<see cref="TheRule_SeesTheStagesDerivedTypes"/>). The rule's population is <c>src/</c>: a test double deriving
/// from the lexer is not product code.
/// Both computed sets are compared, per file, with the inventory PB2291's verdict recorded below. A new read under
/// ANY name — a sixth <c>{isXXXX()}?</c> spelling, a new <c>reservedHere</c> site, a new member, a lexer field primed
/// from the edition, a new listener call — fails here until it is adjudicated and recorded, with its verdict.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why a construct gate is still recorded.</b> PB2291 found three (<see cref="Verdict.ConstructGate"/>), all
/// on the declined Annex A.4 surface of <c>CobolDeclined.g4</c>: the §13.16.2 validation clauses, the VALUE clause's
/// §13.18.63 format-5 phrase and the §12.4.6.3 APPLY COMMIT clause. Below its introducing edition each is refused with a
/// bare COBOL0001 where D7 wants the conformance pass to name the edition (COBOL0900). Moving them needs a
/// declined-construct row form the version matrix does not have yet (a constructs.json row that is refused by name AT
/// and after its introduction), so they are pinned here as defects with their verdict rather than left unseen.
