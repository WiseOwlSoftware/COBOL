/// PB3310: <c>status</c> flags a slot held far past the median of its kind's recorded holds), ⛔ A LIGHT POOL (kb/Work
/// PB3724: a gate whose whole job is script self-tests, the inert lane's Linux half, takes a slot of its own pool with

/// WAITING GATE SAYS WHY (kb/Work PB3724: a later landing ticket served first is named, and so is what the gate next in

/// The cap bounds how many implementer gates build and test at once, repository-wide, so the lander's gate is not
/// starved (train 48's lander leg took 30.6 min against 9.6 quiet). Each property is one arm of the self-test, and
/// each arm was seen to go RED on a planted defect when the tool landed: no ticket check (served out of order), a
/// ticket file counted live whether or not it was locked (the queue never drained), no Job object (the orphaned tree
/// survived its holder), the slot descriptor withheld from children on Linux (the orphans ran outside the cap), and
/// the per-worktree git dir in place of the common dir (two worktrees, two caps).

/// runner under the lander's whole-population gate, so the duplicate went RED as a harness non-observation in both of
/// that train's lander gates with every arm passing. A fixed time limit in a test is a defect; what is left here is the
/// part the runner cannot see — an arm deleted, renamed or left out of the count is red here by name.
