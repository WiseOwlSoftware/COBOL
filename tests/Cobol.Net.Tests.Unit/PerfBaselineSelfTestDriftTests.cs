/// ⛔ THE PERFORMANCE BASELINE'S COMPARISON MUST BE ABLE TO FAIL (kb/Work PB2117): <c>scripts/arch/perf_baseline.py
/// --self-test</c> plants a regression, a peak-memory growth (kb/Work PB2777), a vanished row, an allocation change and
/// a machine change into a synthetic record and must flag each, stay silent on a delta inside the noise band, round-trip
/// its own record format, find the hot-path programs, their witnesses and the benchmark's <c>[Params]</c> to be one set,
/// and see a child process's own peak memory.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Every R3 and R4 wave of the architecture review proves "performance not worse than the R0 baseline beyond noise"
/// (<c>docs/rearchitecture/DESIGN-architecture-review.md</c> §4 item 5) with <c>perf_baseline.py --against</c>, and
/// nothing else compares a time (no test asserts one: kb/Work PB1590). A comparison that had quietly stopped flagging
/// would turn every one of those proofs into a false green, so the self-test runs in every gate and CI job (the runner,
/// scripts/self_tests.py) and the case NAMES
/// are held here from its source (kb/Work PB2882, PB3022): a self-test reduced to its happy path still exits 0. This
/// test runs nothing and times nothing.
