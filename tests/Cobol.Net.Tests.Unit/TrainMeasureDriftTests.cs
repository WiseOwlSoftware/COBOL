/// <summary>
/// ⛔ THE GATING POLICY IS MEASURED ON NUMBERS THAT ARE RECORDED RIGHT (kb/Work PB2515):
/// <c>scripts/orchestrator/train_measure.py --self-test</c> refuses an inconsistent train record and a train recorded
/// twice, and computes the comparison of the gating modes — changes landed per hour, whole-population runs per train, red trains
/// and their attribution time, finishers created by ejection, CI reds — per gating mode, as every arm it names.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The owner made batched gating the rule (2026-10-10, kb/Work PB2515) on what the landers recorded per train against
/// the per-commit whole population (kb/Work PB1708), and every train is still recorded, so the policy stays measured.
/// A summary that miscounted would decide the gate policy on a wrong number, so the self-test runs in every gate and CI job (scripts/self_tests.py) and its arms are
/// held here by name from its source (kb/Work PB2882, PB3022): a self-test reduced to its happy path still exits 0.
