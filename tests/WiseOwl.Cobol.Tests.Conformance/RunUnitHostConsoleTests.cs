/// kb/Work PB3193: A RUN UNIT EMBEDDED IN A HOST PROCESS NEVER RECONFIGURES THE HOST'S CONSOLE. The process console
/// (<c>Console.Out</c>, <c>Console.Error</c> and <c>Console.OutputEncoding</c>) belongs to the process, and only an
/// entry that IS the process configures it: the <c>cobol</c> CLI's <c>Main</c> and the generated <c>Main</c>'s
/// <c>ProgramRegistry.RunModule</c> ("A standalone <c>cobol</c> executable IS its own host", docs/CONFORMANCE.md
/// DOC-A.1-167), which set UTF-8 there (DOC-A.1-59; kb/Work PB59, PB899). Under a host, the standard display device
/// is the host's standard output exactly as the host configured it (DOC-A.1-59), and the run unit only writes to it.
/// This is the console twin of <see cref="RunUnitHostExitCodeTests"/> (kb/Work PB3163), and the rule behind both is
/// §14.6.1's "A run unit is an independent entity that may be executed without communicating with, or being
/// coordinated with, any other run unit": a run unit that rewrote a process-wide cell would coordinate with the host
/// through it.
/// <para>The host is a real C# program compiled with Roslyn and run as its own process. It first gives its console an
/// encoding of its own (ISO 8859-1, code page 28591), then installs its OWN writers for standard output and standard
/// error, then activates a program through its generated host entry (<c>Cobol.HCDISP.HCDISP.Call</c>,
/// DESIGN-external-repository §4.3, the one host surface of §4.4) that DISPLAYs wide characters
/// on the standard display device and UPON SYSERR. Expected, derived: the host's two writers and its encoding are all
/// still in force afterwards, and each DISPLAY reached the host's writer for its device, every character intact
/// (a writer holds UTF-16, so nothing is encoded on the way). Before the fix the run unit's first activation set
/// UTF-8 on the host's console (code page 65001), or, where the console refused, replaced both writers with its
/// own, so the DISPLAYs bypassed the host's.</para>
