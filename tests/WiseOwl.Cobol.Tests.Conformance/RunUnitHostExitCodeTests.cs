/// kb/Work PB3163 — A RUN UNIT EMBEDDED IN A HOST PROCESS NEVER WRITES THE HOST'S EXIT CODE (docs/CONFORMANCE.md
/// DOC-A.1-167: "STOP RUN, and a fatal exception condition that terminates the run unit (§14.6.12), end the RUN UNIT
/// ONLY — never the host process"; "A standalone <c>cobol</c> executable IS its own host"). The termination status of a
/// run unit — STOP's STATUS operand (§14.9.42.4 GR5: the value is "passed to the operating system") or the
/// abnormal-termination indication (§14.6.12) — is the RUN UNIT's own state: under a host it travels in the
/// <c>RunUnitEndedException</c> the outermost boundary throws (owner decision R48), and only the boundary that IS the
/// process entry (the generated <c>Main</c>) delivers a status to the process exit code. §14.6.1 — "A run unit is an
/// independent entity that may be executed without communicating with, or being coordinated with, any other run unit" —
/// is the standard's side of it: a run unit that rewrote a process-wide cell would coordinate with every other run unit,
/// and with the host, through it.
/// <para>The host here is a real C# program compiled with Roslyn and run as its own process, exactly as an embedding
/// host would be. It sets its OWN exit code (5) first, then activates four programs through their generated host entries
/// (<c>Cobol.&lt;assembly&gt;.&lt;NAME&gt;.Call</c>, DESIGN-external-repository §4.3, the one host surface of §4.4): one
/// ending in <c>STOP RUN WITH ERROR STATUS 24</c>, one ending abnormally on a fatal EC-DATA-PTR-NULL (a NULL BASED
/// reference, §14.6.12), one whose CALL of an absent program fails (§14.9.4.4 GR3 b), which the host receives as the
/// condition itself and which ends no run unit, and a status-free one. After each it reports the process exit code.
/// Expected, derived: the process exit code stays 5 throughout (the host's own); the host receives status 24 (normal),
/// then status 1 (ERROR ⇒ 1, the item-192 mapping; abnormal), then EC-PROGRAM-NOT-FOUND; the run unit current after the
/// last activation has status 0; and the host process ends with the exit code it set.</para>
